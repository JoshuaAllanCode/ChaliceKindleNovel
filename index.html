		<h2<Prologue to the Prologue</h2>
  		<h2>The Destroyer's will</h2>
    			<p>All that was evil followed a man by the name of Sabot. He walked upon earth in the same days as did his antithesis, Jesus Christ.</p>
    			<p>While Christ spoke of peace and healing: Sabot spoke of war and disease. While Christ prepared and gave sermons on mountain tops; Sabot spoke in whispers deep within the darkest of caverns. While Christ drew the little children to him; Sabot despised their innocence and their smiles. Both were men of purpose, both were men of power and both were kings. Christ was hated by the people he loved and was crucified. Sabot was loved by the people he hated and died an old man. They died on the same day.</p>
    			<p>On the eve of their deaths, feasts were prepared by their followers. Christ held and raised the golden chalice, (which would become known as the Holy Grail), and said, "This is my blood, drink it all of you," and as the men drank the wine, the covenant between God and man was sealed for eternity.</p>
    			<p>In the darkness of a catacomb, Sabot raised the golden chalice, (which would become known as The Destroyer's will) , and said, "This is the blood of man, drink of it," and as the men drank the sacrificial offering, the covenant between evil and man was sealed for eternity.</p>
    			<p>After their deaths, the Holy Grail was lost to history; never to be recovered. The Destroyer's will gained purpose and was protected, for evil was not afraid. The remaining chalice was to be used as a signal, a call, to bring out those who followed for a convergence of their powers and the destruction of man. The chalice was pure evil. Its purpose and scope had never been contaminated by hesitation or doubt.</p>
    			<p>The chalice was passed down from father to bastard son, throughout the centuries, for use in only such rituals: the black feasts of death which called forth the Destroyer.</p>
 		 <h2>(2)</h2>
			<p>The smell of burning bodies was carried by the night's breeze. It was a heavy and sweet scent which filled one's lungs with despair. Sabot had been dead for over one hundred years. And now, for the first time since the chalice had first held blood, it was to be used once again.</p>
			<p>The victims of the fire, those who had been the necessary sacrifice, were being thrown into hand carts and transported for a more complete burning at the edge of the village.</p>
			<p>The albino, known only as Partee, son of no one—for no man had ever publicly claimed him as his blood-stood and surveyed the destruction. He had done well and as his father would have wished. He held out his left hand, and in his right was a knife. Partee dragged the blade across the flesh of his palm and the blood ran freely. He dropped the knife and picked up the chalice and allowed his blood to drain into the golden goblet. He watched this with fascination and little pain. Soon he was completely transfixed upon the drops of blood which were now filling the chalice. In this state he did not notice that others had begun to join him on top of the hill. There were no introductions, and no words were spoken. Soon there were three, then six and finally thirteen. They all sat in a circle surrounding Partee. The albino finished filling the goblet and slowly raised his eyes to those who had gathered around him.</p>
			<p>"This is the blood of man, drink of it," and he passed the chalice. When the cup returned to his hands, he lifted the goblet and drank, being the last of the circle, Partee finished the remaining sacrament and said, "Go forth, and bring praise upon the Destroyer."</p>
			<p>The men left as silently as they had arrived. In the months that followed the world became more cruel, decadent and diseased. And death reigned freely.</p>
		<h2>(3)</h2>
			<p>The chalice was used seven times over the next thirteen hundred years. The initiation and results of several of those events would never be recorded in history, for some atrocities were simply too perverse to be believed and were therefore clouded in secrecy. Others would be misinterpreted as to their origin,such as, the blood  baths of the crusades and the black plagues of Europe and England. Still, the chalice was always there during such times of death and tragedy and the same message was always given out to the disciples of pain, "Go forth and bring praise upon the Destroyer."</p>
		<h2<(4)</h2>
			<p>"Jonathan, you know that I can never give you my name. But I will provide you with the greatest of gifts. Something which will bring you power the likes of such you cannot believe. This same gift was given to me in my eighteenth year, by my father, who also could not provide me with the legitimacy which I desired. This is how it has always been and how it shall always be until the earth is no longer, this gift must be passed on to a bastard son."</p>
			<p>The young man who stood with the older were both of that rare recessive disorder: both were albinos.</p>
			<p>"What can you give me, Father, that shall remove the shame I have endured for so many years? The shame of being half a man, the shame of having to listen to the whispers as I walk alone on the streets?"</p>
			<p>"My son, I myself have never used the gift which I 'm offering you. There was not the need and perhaps I was not strong enough. " The older man reached into a soiled leather bag and pulled out a gold chalice. He handed it to the younger man.</p>
			<p>"What is this, Father? Some joke? Am I supposed to be pleased with a gold cup? Is this supposed to atone for my pain?"</p>
			<p>"That gold cup is known as the Destroyer's Will. It possesses immense power, and it shares such power with anyone who is chosen to protect it from harm.</p>
			<p>How do you think I acquired the' wealth that you envy? I was not born to riches. I, like you, was a bastard and had nothing, nothing until my father presented me with the chalice and then everything changed. Women desired me. Men feared me and wealth seemed to come from everything that I touched. The same will happen to you, my son, if you abide by the will of the chalice. The chalice is said to be pure evil, but that should not frighten you for evil is a force, a power to use as you so please. There is however one requirement, and that is if the chalice desires to be fed—-and you will know if such a time comes-—you must do so. The ritual that you must use, and the answers to any questions that you may have are contained within this book. " Once again the old man reached into the leather bag and pulled out a large black book.</p>
			<p>"This is the book of the Destroyer. Read it, all of it, and you will understand. There is one other thing that you must know. To be the protector of the chalice is your destiny and you do not have a choice in that matter. If you do not care for the chalice, or if you fail to act as its protector you will die a most unpleasant death. But again, do not be frightened, you were damned the day you were born. It was your fate as it is mine." The old man handed the book to his son.</p>
			<p>The younger albino held the chalice and the book in his hands. He thought it somewhat funny that his father kept telling him not to be frightened, for he was not frightened by anything. As far as evil was concerned, he was already very well versed in that area, taking whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. He knew that he was damned and the thought did not upset him. Jonathan realized that he had been given a great gift, a gift of power and influence, a gift that would assist him in achieving whatever he may desire: the gift of evil.</p>
			<p>"I shall not see you again, boy," said the older man as he turned and walked off into the darkness. Jonathan was now a powerful man. He turned and walked off toward his new life. The chalice felt strong and at home within his hands. "Praise the Destroyer," he said, although at the time he did not understand why.</p>
		<h2>Prologue</h2>
		<h2>Devil's Parade</h2>
			<p>Barnett had returned from Viet Nam just six months ago. He was one of the last to leave the country back in 1972. Now he was working for the L.A.P.D. He wasn't really sure how much he liked police work, but he never got bored. Bill had heard the stories about policemen who spent the majority of their time hanging around in donut  shops, drinking coffee, laughing with the regulars, and gaining weight. L.A., wasn't that way, when you were on duty you were under fire. In this big city anyone could target out a cop and blow him away. And the reason behind it could be anything from some fight with a spouse, to radio messages from Mars; in other words someone really didn't need a reason to shoot a cop. The police were convenient targets easily identified, and scattered around the city. Their uniforms acted like magnets for the hate and mind diseases which grew like weeds in a forgotten garden: this city of L.A.</p>
			<p>Bill had a couple of things going for him: he was a big man, over six four and close to two hundred and fifty pounds, (and that was muscle, well, mostly muscle), and secondly, Bill Barnett could read minds. Both of these characteristics tended to be very helpful in maintaining his own prime objective of staying alive within the City of Angels.</p>
			<p>Of course Bill didn't tell a lot of people he could read their thoughts. First off, Bill didn't like looking around in someone's private things, like their underwear drawers, personal diaries, or their minds. Secondly, being able to pick up on someone's thoughts just wasn't the kind of thing that you told someone, unless you wanted to end up on the backward of some state nut-hut making baskets and smiling for the psychiatrists. Instead, people just tended to think that Bill was perceptive or intuitive, perhaps very intuitive, but being intuitive makes someone interesting and valuable, whereas reading minds makes them a freak. Bill thought it was just fine that his friends and enemies alike thought he was damn perceptive. Bill just agreed with them, even if he could 'see' they were thinking, "Son of a bitch is always taking all the glory. One day I 'm going kick his ass."</p>
			<p>Bill wasn't married, probably never would be, his gift got in the way. Bill didn't have any family left anywhere, well he did, but his parents had been so frightened by his abilities they had closed themselves out of his life many years ago. Bill was a loner, he wasn't sure if he liked that fact, but at least he understood the requirements of the role. And pretty soon, everywhere he went or had been, he became, "Big 01' quiet Bill. " He wasn't that old, twenty—seven, but he was quiet, not that Bill was a shy man, but a man of few words; stoic. Still the name stuck and Bill figured he could have been dubbed a lot worse, so he began to wear his nick name like a jacket and everyone was used to seeing him in those colors: big and quiet.</p>
			<p>Bill's partner was a man named Steve Rivera. Steve's parents had come over from Cuba in the early fifties. Steve wasn't all that thrilled with his heritage, and he often thought of changing his last name to Rivers, but he figured it would hurt his parents, make his mother cry, his father angry and so on, so he didn't. Steve didn't like the job of breaking in new recruits. He thought it was dangerous, and Steve didn't get off on danger. Steve had been on the force for eleven years and after that amount of time you learned that danger and death went together. But Bill was different. Hell, Steve felt safe around Bill. Sometimes he felt like he was the rookie. Bill had a real presence about him and the people on the street could feel it. The two of them had been doing a great job cleaning up their beat. Bill just seemed to know who was causing the trouble, who had done what and where. Steve had concluded that the guy was some kind of psychic. Still he never let Bill in on his conclusion. Steve understood people liked to be respected for their intuition and their perceptive abilities and not dubbed as some kind of circus freak. So he never told Bill he thought he was psychic. Steve was a very perceptive guy.</p>
			<p>Of course Bill knew that Steve was aware of his gift. He didn't ride around with his partner all day long, five days a week, for years and not know what Steve was thinking. Still, Bill never said anything to Steve which would have indicated that he could read his partner's mind. Besides being able to read minds, Bill also tended to be very a perceptive man. The two men had been partners for eight years on the morning that Bill shot Joe Mullins.</p>
		<h2>(2)</h2>
			<p>Until the Devil's Parade, there had been no purpose in his life. He had been involved in crime since he could remember. He committed his first armed robbery when he was fifteen, killed a man before his eighteenth birthday, and had broken into more homes than he could count. Still he had no direction. Joe Mullins just did things, he never thought about what he was going to do. He was just like a bad storm cloud on a hell of a windy day: he could end up anywhere and more often than not, where he ended up bad things would happen. It was just some kind of fate or destiny as far as Joe was concerned, he wrote  the whole mess off by saying, "I'm just a bad seed." Joe would smile after he told people this. It typically made others very uncomfortable and Joe enjoyed making people uncomfortable perhaps as much as he did spending the night with a fifty—dollar whore: both got him off. Besides, it was just his style.</p>
			<p>Joe hadn't had any intention of getting involved in some cult group. Typically, he would have thought the idea revolting.</p>
			<p>Joe Mullins was a lone wolf, others just tended to get into his way. But then he was held in jail for a couple of days, with a cell-mate named McKey. McKey was a member of the Devil's Parade and knew all kinds of neat hocus—pocus shit, like making the guards say things they hadn't intended on saying and making Joe scratch his balls even if he hadn't wanted to. McKey said it was his 'will' that made people do what he wanted and that he could make someone do just about anything.</p>
			<p>"What about killing someone? Could you make someone do that?" Joe had asked McKey.</p>
			<p>"Probably not. It's gotta be in them, they would have had to have done it before. But let me tell you this, and it's the whole point of the Parade: if you can convince someone that nothing is true, that there is no right or wrong, then you can use your 'will' to get them to do whatever you desire. Pretty slick, huh, Sparky?"</p>
			<p>"What's this Sparky shit?"</p>
			<p>"I just like saying it, Sparky."</p>
			<p>"Well, I'd just like to smash in your fucking face. No one calls me, 'Sparky'," said Joe as he tried to lunge at McKey. He couldn't move. "Hey, what is this shit?"</p>
			<p>"You're just responding to my will, Sparky."</p>
			<p>Joe decided he wanted to get involved in the Parade after that day. The Parade could offer him something even more important than making people uncomfortable. The Parade could offer him control and power.</p>
			<p>Joe ran into McKey later that month, in a low class tequila bar on the west side, (Joe had been released from jail the authorities didn't have enough evidence to hold him).</p>
			<p>"Hey, McKey, I'd like to join that group of yours. Any problem?"</p>
			<p>"No problem, if you can get past initiation."</p>
			<p>"What initiation?"</p>
			<p>"You have to do something horrible," McKey smiled.</p>
			<p>"Well, I've done horrible things my whole life," said Joe, smiling back.</p>
			<p>"Yeah, but you have to do something horrible for absolutely no reason at all. No reason other than to bring glory upon the One we serve. In the past you've always had a reason. Maybe very small reasons, but still reasons, like someone got in your way or you wanted something that they had, but you had a reason. To get into the Parade you have to change to balance of innocence. You kill someone for no reason what so ever. You do that, Sparky and you'll get into the Parade."</p>
			<p>"No reason at all?"</p>
			<p>"No reason, Sparky. You just do."</p>
			<p>"I can do that."</p>
			<p>"I thought that you probably could," McKey smiled again.</p>
			<p>After the conversation Joe left the bar and walked home to his little apartment on the west side. He thought long into the night about what he could do that would be so deplorable as to guarantee his acceptance into the Parade. Joe decided that he would kill a group of elementary aged school children. He would just blow them off the fucking earth. It would be easy, just take a few sticks of dynamite into Park Street Elementary, which was less than a block from his home, then place the sticks next to some first or second grade classroom. Maybe a kindergarten room? Yeah, kindergarten. Joe had his plan, now he just needed the materials. He was sure he could do it, and then he would learn how to be powerful. Joe had picked up the dynamite from a ranch supply house later that day. In the evening he was so excited, so filled with anticipation that he couldn't sleep. Joe went back down to the seedy bar where he had run into McKey earlier. And he ran into McKey once more. Joe couldn't contain himself. He told McKey of his plan.</p>
			<p>McKey had smiled and said, "Come with me, Joe. You will wear our mark on the day of your glory. " The two of them left the bar and entered a small tattoo parlor. Once inside the parlor, the artist, who was large man with his skin covered with tattoos of women in various suggestive and lewd positions, started to work on Joe. The proprietor placed a tattoo of a playing card, a king, the king of hearts, upon Joe's upper right arm. The suicide king.</p>
			<p>Joe Mullins was now as good as a member of the Devil's Parade. There was just one more requirement, one little thing to do, and Joe was positive he could do it, for killing was in his blood and his destiny was assured; in the morning the children would die.</p>
		<h2>(3)</h2>
			<p>Bill and Steve came on shift at 6 a.m. and had been on duty less than a hour as Mullins finished his night of drinking and was walking back to his apartment to pick up the explosive. Bill's 'gift' had been on full blast since he had awakened, sometimes it was like that. Bill was picking up everything and everything was very clear. He would see some guy walking his dog, make eye contact, and then Bill would pick up an entire conversation the man had at breakfast. Bill could 'see' if someone had been in a fight with their spouse. He could 'see' if someone had been involved in something he shouldn't have been involved in. The people walking the street, driving cars or passed out on the sidewalks had no secrets this morning, for Bill Barnett could see it all.</p>
			<p>Bill saw Joe walking down the sidewalk and Joe's thoughts hit Bill like a Claymore mine.</p>
			<p>Bill saw that Joe intended on killing a large number of children. He could see the parents crying; the pain of the dying, and he knew it was going to happen.</p>
			<p>Bill didn't say anything to Steve, he just pulled the cruiser over to the curb and opened the door.</p>
			<p>"Hey, Bill, what are you doing?" Steve had asked. Bill didn't respond. Steve could tell something was wrong, very wrong. Bill looked like a man with mission, not one of L.A.'s finest. Steve tried another approach, "Come on, Bill, let's go get some coffee. No reason to start the day out on a shitty note."</p>
			<p>Bill still didn't respond. He never looked away from Mullins. Bill got out of the car, walked over and touched Joe on the shoulder. Bill was flooded with this man's thoughts. Bill felt a brief moment of panic as he thought, "What do I do? What can I do?"</p>
			<p>By this time Mullins was screaming about police brutality and how he had never done a "fucking thing to nobody."</p>
			<p>Bill's thoughts raced. The little voice inside his mind was saying, "You've got to do something, Bill. If you don't it will happen. And if the children die you'll be as much to blame as this guy, because you know..." Bill questioned himself, "But what can I do? I mean, the guy hasn't done anything</p>

"Oh, but he will, Billy-boy. You know that he will," the little voice in his mind replied. "The way I see things, you really don't have much choice. Not really any choice at all. If you just try to lock him up, he'll be out in a day or so and what you have seen will still happen. You could tell him that you know what he's going to do. But I think that would just make it more challenging. Nope, Billy-boy, not really any choice. You have to kill him."
"All right, Mullins, up against the wall and spread 'um." Bill pushed him toward the building.
"I'm getting a lawyer, man. And when I do you're going get fired. You going to get more than fired. I'm going sue you for every penny you got! I'm a tax paying citizen, man. I pay your salary!"
"Shut—up, Mullins. Just give me your hands."
Mullins did.
Bill put the cuffs on the man and touched him on the shoulder one more time.
"What are you trying to do, touching me all the time? You some sort of gay boy or something?" Mullins said, he was having fun with this big old cop.
Bill didn't respond. He was once again seeing what this man intended to do. He saw the children, he saw those who had tears and those who would never again cry. Bill unsnapped his holster, freeing his revolver.
"Hey, Bill! What in the hell are you doing?" Steve was yelling as he was attempting to get out of the car. Several pedestrians and store owners had now emerged onto the sidewalk. "Bill!" Steve yelled once more as he finally opened the car door.
"Hey, wait a minute, man. I ain't done nothing. Wait! Hey!
Bill had his service revolver drawn from it's holster and had pulled back the hammer. He raised the gun to the back of Mullins' head.
"Don't!" screamed Steve.
"Well, fuck you!" yelled Mullins.
Bill pulled the trigger.

The old man sat alone in the darkness when McKey entered the house that was headquarters for the Devil's Parade. The house contained no furnishings and the walls had been painted black. The air within the building smelled of sickness and disease. It was that musky smell that was at one moment overpowering, then faded, yet lingered and smelled sweet: the house smelled of death.
The old man lit a single candle as he heard McKey approach.
"Master?" McKey tentatively asked the emptiness which surrounded him.
"I am here, my son."
McKey walked quickly toward the voice. He was now standing before his Master. The old man sat nude upon the floor.
"Master, the man I told you about, Mullins. He has failed us."
"I am aware of that, my son."
"Master, what are we to do now?" McKey had taken a step back.
"We create what we require. Send out word to our brethren throughout the country to recruit children and initiate them in our ways. Out of many we will find one to accept his soul. We still have time, my son. We will find our Nightmare Man."
"Yes, my Master. I will see that it is done." McKey began to turn away from the old man.
"McKey."
"Yes, Master?"
"I require pleasure."
"Yes, Master," and McKey turned and faced the old man. He then dropped to his knees. The old man blew out the candle. Sometime later McKey screamed in the darkness.

And about the time that Bill Barnett was being released from prison, a child was born. He was normal in every way, except for one: Philip Justin Wagner was born with a sixth finger on his left hand.
His mother, Kate, asked the attending Physician what the slight deformity might mean.
"Well, it means he has to have a minor operation on his hand. Cosmetic really, there's no bone, just that little bit of flesh. Philip won't even know he ever had the procedure. However, you may find this interesting: if we were followers of the occult, Philip's extra finger would mean that your son was a born with a sixth sense." The doctor laughed nervously.
Kate smiled, and then she pulled her newborn son to her breast.
Chapter One
The Beast Himself
The year was 1691. Jonathan Iverson had been convicted of consorting with the devil by a magistrate of the King of England. He was condemned to die. To die as all warlocks or witches were executed: Jonathan was to be burned alive with the coming of the dawn. 
After the verdict in the afternoon, Jonathan was incarcerated in the tower. It was totally secure, escape was impossible. Iron bars over an inch in diameter, spaced three inches apart covered a window ten feet from the floor. The door to the cell was solid iron also, with a four inch window through which he and the guards could communicate, if they were so inclined. Of course, no guard would dare to talk to    Jonathan, for he was found guilty of being a male witch. Warlocks possessed the power of bewitchment, the power to have others carry out their will. The guards secretly feared the man, although they would not have admitted any such fear. Their concealed horror was apparent in the treatment of this man. Unlike other prisoners, Jonathan had been shackled, both his arms and legs, and thrown to the floor of his cell to await his death. The iron chains which held him were not removed. The prison guards quietly moved down the stairs away from his cell. The guards sat, watching the late afternoon sun, wishing for the coming of dawn's first light. Then the man would die and the guard‘s fears would take flight like a small bird, allowing them to feel like men again.
Just as the sun cracked the black sky, three guards climbed the _one hundred and fifty stairs to the top of the tower, where Jonathan would be awaiting them. The first guard peered through the small window in the door. He could see nothing. The three men conversed briefly, determined that the prisoner had lain down flat on the floor, next to the door to avoid being seen. They were positive the prisoner remained within the cell. The guards could see no signs of an escape, the cell was in order.
Everything was as it should be, except the prisoner was out of their sight. The guards knew the man was shackled, he could not put up much, if any resistance, to three strong men who knew their job and knew well how to restrain or immobilize a prisoner. Even if such a prisoner happened to be a warlock.
The first guard inserted his key into the iron door and turned it. As the lock freed itself, all three guards entered the cell like a cat who takes that final leap at a cornered rodent.
The cell was empty.

Once free from the cell, Jonathan returned to his coven. Thirteen females whom he had taught the black arts. Thirteen females of the Wicca; practitioners of the Craft: Jonathan's witches awaited him. Not one member of the coven asked how Jonathan had freed himself, they had all seen him do wondrous feats of magik. They had all seen him become spirit and roam the night skies with the wind. The witches understood that Jonathan was the master of matter--he could be or not be, that was part of his greatness—-and they would follow him anywhere and fulfill any of his desires.
Jonathan was a tall man, over six feet. He looked to be young and vital, even though his age neared forty-seven years. It was his eyes which defined his face. They were the eyes of despair and pain itself; empty, frightening, yet alluring, calling out a song of sadness to anyone who was willing to meet his gaze. Perhaps foremost his eyes attracted such attention because of their color, not a blue, brown or hazel, Jonathan's irises were red, or pink, depending on the lighting and time of day. Jonathan was a man devoid of pigmentation. He possessed that rare recessive disorder which left his skin translucent white, his hair whiter than the oldest of men and his veins filled with a blue blood which stood out against his body as if he were transparent. This veinous blood, absent of oxygen, gave the impression that Jonathan's circulatory system was in reality a maze created by some horrible little creature which had been burrowing just under his skin and feasting upon his flesh.
To further expose the contrast, Jonathan wore clothing which was as black as polished obsidian. It was as if color did not exist, his world appeared to be one of black and white, and sometimes grey. But no color ever graced his body, there would never be color, for color graced the living. One other aspect of his dress attracted one's attention, Jonathan Iverson never wore shoes. He required skin contact with the earth below him, for it was from below that he gained his powers.
During periods of ritual, when he and his coven would gather around the hollow flames of fire, Jonathan would wear a heavy black wool hooded cloak. The man appeared to be death himself.
Due to his unique features, Jonathan knew he could not remain hidden long within his native country of England. His escape from the Prison of Alterburrow was a monumental feat, for before him, no one had ever escaped from the stone enclosures of such secure containment. Alterburrow had been constructed to contain men like Jonathan: violent, dangerous and corrupt of heart.
Shortly after Jonathan had freed himself from his cell, he gathered his coven and informed the women of his favor; that they were to be passengers on a large sailing craft which would take them to the new world. It would take them to a new country which listed religious freedom as a right of all men. Of course, Jonathan was aware that witches had been burned in Salem, Massachusetts. However, as he informed his coven, they were no longer witches, but rather a protestant sect that believed in polygamy. Stating biblical verse related to the commandment of God to be fruitful and multiply, the coven were his wives and he their husband. The women said nothing, but stared deep into his red eyes; irises which appeared to be glowing coals in the darkness.
"I have arranged for passage on a ship which leaves with the early morning's high tide; approximately one hour from now, or two hours before this day's dawn. The dawn which those foolish guards shall know they were unable to contain me.Then it shall be the guards who will die for their irresponsibility. Prepare, for we leave soon, to new and greater rewards." Jonathan began to laugh as walked to the small house which had been his and his coven's sanctuary. He needed to take only three items with him on this journey; his personal grimore, the black book and the chalice. He would change his clothes. He had seen Amish men, in their black suits and black hats—-religious zealots. Jonathan intended on becoming a religious zealot, and so he dressed in kind. After all, he intended on becoming know n as a trusted, respectable and highly religious man.

"Whatda we do, mate?" asked one of the three guards who had found the empty cell.
"Well, the way I see it, we got two choices. The first one is that we let those bloody bastards burn us for setting that wicked one free. I myself don't much cotton to that idea. The second is we take another prisoner, let him be burned at the stake."
"How do ya think we could pull that off? You know that the witch man was whiter than my old lady's ass and he had them damn red eyes that looked like a smith's coals. Everyone will know for sure that we got the wrong bloody bloak."
"Not if we tie his 'ands behind 'is back, and cover 'is 'ead with an executioner's bag. No one will see 'is face, no one will be the wiser and everyone will see the body burn. So what do you want to bloody
do?"
"Hey, ain't that old shit down in Cell Seventeen a mute? I ain't never heard him say a word. He's about as tall as the witch, too."
"Like I said, mate. I don't cotton to being burned myself and I don't much care for any man locked up in this place. I say we 'em burn the mute."
"Let's do it, then."
That dawn as the fire raged around a man who screamed in silence, the smell of burning flesh filled the air. The small English town of Alterburrow felt cleaner, for everyone assumed that Jonathan Iverson had been burned at the stake.

Jonathan, and the female members of the coven waited on the dock as the HMS Devenshire was loaded with cargo for America. The Devenshire was an older ship, but well maintained with a seasoned crew. Thetide had passed high and soon the sea would again begin it's retreat, with passengers, cargo and crew. Sails were masted and passengers began to board. Jonathan and his women were to be awarded a series of private cabins, those who had entered into indentured servitude for passage--the majority of passengers——were to be moved to a single large galley below deck. 
The crew members had gathered with the first officer to oversee the boarding of the passengers. One of the crew members commented on Jonathan's appearance, saying, "Bloody albino, 'e is. I 'ave seen one before, in the Spice Islands. Looks like walking dead, 'e does."
The first officer heard the comment, as did the rest of the crew, and addressed his men, "Maybe he is one of the dead, but he paid for his fare and that of the women with twenty pieces of gold. So we are going to treat the man with all the bloody respect of the
King himself. And maybe, just maybe, there will be more gold for us when we reach the other shore. Understand me, mates?" The first officer looked around at his crew who had all returned to the tasks necessary to cast off. The officer smiled and escorted Jonathan and the women to the forward cabins.
The first officer opened the door to Jonathan's cabin and tried to look him in the eyes. He did so momentarily, then pulled his gaze away like he had touched a hot stove. As he turned and walked away from the coven and their master, the officer thought, "The bloody bastard don't look dead, he looks like the devil himself."
Within minutes, the ship was underway to the new world, with new identities and new opportunities. Oh yes, the opportunities were endless and this was just the beginning.
(5)
Twenty—seven days later the Devenshire set port in Virginia. The crossing had been long and filled with tragedy. Thirty—one of the galley passengers had died of some strange malady. Plague had infested the ship, or so it had been said.
The Devenshire had been found eleven miles off the coast, adrift, sails lowered, with a strange flag at her mast. The flag was that of a single gold goblet, unknown to any seaman who had sailed the Atlantic. The Captain of the Monolith, an angry man, with bright red hair and a beard the color of late afternoon sun, ordered the HMS Monolith, an English vessel of war, to board the Devenshire.
The crew who were selected for the task were less than enthusiastic. They were well aware that a ship with sails down and no sign of movement typically meant that the ship had been pirated. It was obvious to all that the Devenshire was an old vessel, which the crew of the Monolith assumed was the reason she had not been taken. What did cause some degree of apprehension was why the ship had been left intact, instead of the usual practice of pirates to place a few cannon balls into the ship's hull, sinking the vessel deep into the sea, leaving no trace of their actions.
The six mariners who crossed over the ropes, (which had now secured the Devenshire to the Monolith), began their search in the upper cabins. The first man whom they saw was Jonathan, he being an albino, the men believed he was some type of ghost who was now haunting‘the empty ship. The women came out of their cabins and feigned excitement and elation, regarding their rescue.
Jonathan was, the first to speak, “It was the plague, I'm sure of it. They are all dead but us. The crew was first and began to pass away two weeks ago, then the other passengers began to die. For some reason the disease did not affect us. Don't ask me why”
The crew members didn't.
A small emergency craft was lowered into the water and tied several hundred yards behind the Monolith.
"You folks are going to have to ride in that," said a tired looking sailor, as he pointed to the small emergency vessel. "I hope you understand that we can not risk infecting our crew."
Jonathan and the women nodded their affirmance. The men pulled the small craft along side of the Devenshire. Jonathan and the women quickly scaled down the limp ropes to the little boat. There were two crew members who still remained upon the Devenshire. They quickly set flame to the ship and crawled like spiders across the ropes and back onto the Monolith.
"Plague it was, but for the ghost man and the women not a soul was alive."
The Captain nodded and had the sails turned easterly, moving the Monolith quickly away from the burning Devenshire. Had the crew members of the Monolith taken the time to further investigate what had occurred on the ship, they would have found no sign of plague, (although it was true that not another person was alive on the Devenshire) . Instead, they would have found bodies——both of the crew and passengers who appeared to have participated in some sort of mass suicide—-the adults wrist's had been cut to allow their life's blood to drain. The children who had been among the passengers had been suffocated by having pieces of clothing stuffed into their mouths and noses. Those few children who had apparently broken free, had their throats cut.
From the small dingy, which was being pulled along by the Monolith, Jonathan said to his coven, "I can smell America, I can see land. " The witches all smiled.
The ship's crew had gathered on the rear deck. As they watched the small boat being hauled behind them into a vastness of ocean and waves; they felt an unexplained fear of the riders in the water.
Although, none of the sailors would verbalize their thoughts, (after all they had saved the remaining passengers from a sure death-~or so they believed) The seafaring men felt as though perhaps they should have let the remaining passengers die.
For some reason——a rarity occurred upon the sea—-the wind quickly changed course and was now heading from the north.
Chapter Two
Burials
The bodies of the women lay upon each other smelling of death. Their execution had been carried out in the darkness over the final days. Fire raged within the confines of the small Midwestern town, the smoke dancing in the air as it was drawn towards the stars.
Jonathan Iverson held the gold chalice in his hand and isilently watched the destruction.
The town's minister, an old and tired man who walked with the weight of his failures, climbed silently towards the tall albino man who stood on the ridge. The minister's clothes were covered with soot, ash and lilood from the final rounds he had made this evening to visit his dying parishioners.
This day of death.
The albino man looked down the hill and watched with amusement as the tired old man slipped and fell  as he continued to make his ascent up the hill.
"Turn and run, old man. There is nothing up here for YUP. There is nothing up here but death. Run, before? death catches you, too!" yelled the albino man.
The 01d man continued to climb.
"D1dn?'t you hear me, you old fool? I said run!"
The minister crested the hill. He pushed himself upright and stood in front of the albino.
"Jonathan Iverson, I had heard that you had been burned at the stake back in Alterburrow years ago. Of course, I thought that you were still alive, but as I said, I had been told that you were dead. Perhaps I simply allowed myself to hope," stated the minister as he wiped his ash covered blackened hands on his black pants.
"Apparently someone provided you with false information; As you can see, I am quite alive. Much more so than my coven of whores." The albino man looked over to the pile of bodies which rested to his left.
"You still have the chalice, I see."
"Oh yes, you powerless old fool. Look around you Martin, and see the splendor of all I have created, all that I have destroyed." The albino man raised his hands above his head and then opened them like a flower in bloom.
"Why did you kill your own?" asked the minister as he lobked at the bodies. "I understand your murdering the town, killing the innocent, the Women and children, but why your own?"
The albino smiled, "Because it gave me pleasure, old man. And because they are of more use to me dead than they were alive," a smile twisted his lips.
"I see," said the minister, still attempting to find his breath.
'Why are you here, priest?" he demanded, his red eyes had narrowed and burrowed into the holy man like spikes of steel.
"I'm not a priest, Jonathan. I'm Protestant."
"You can't stop what has began. There's no way, for the sacrifice have been made and I have taken the toast froh the chalice." The albino raised the gold cup to his lips and drank deeply. "Soon the others will join me and the feast will begin. "
"I have brought you something, Jonathan. Something that I believe you will enjoy."
The tall albino man wiped the red stains from his mouth. "What is it holy fool, a cross? No, I'm sure you're more sophisticated than that. Perhaps something dint of myth, an ancient spice or talisman? I must say you have caught my interest."
The minister reached into his pocket and pulled out a gold icube. The object was small, two inches, by two and the? gold was highly polished and smooth.
There appeared to be no etchings or marks or the small square and the fire lights of the burning town reflected oln the object's planes. "It is a music box of sorts, Jionathan. But only the most privileged may hear the box's melodies. I bring this to you as a gift, an offering of peace to the man who bested me."
The minister handed the box to the albino.
"Your God certainly did not save you. Did he, holy man?"
"No, he did not." The minister hesitated, "May I ask you a question, Jonathan?"
"You may ask," said the albino as he twirled the gold box around in his hand. He still held the gold chalice ih the other.
"Why? I understand that you are an evil man... "
The albino interrupted, "Not evil, I am a Warlock, man of great powers, but I am not an evil man. Those stories of good and evil belong to holy men."
“Yes” I believe that may be true." The old man wiped the sweat from his brow, "Still, my question is this: What have you truly accomplished? I know I see only the surface, only the beginning. What have you actually done, Jonathan?"
"You did not know what I was attempting?" 
"I knew only that innocent people would die. That was all I needed to know to try and stop you."
"I have called forth the Destroyer." The gold box still moved in the albino's hand as if it was warming and melting like ice.
"The destroyer?" The minister appeared confused. "I do not understand the meaning of your words, Warlock. Is this destroyer some ancient god from an other time?"
The small gold box within the albino's hands had begun to produce a soft whining sound.
"Preacher, there are no ancient gods."
"Where is this destroyer of whom you speak?"
"Everywhere."
"I see nothing."
"That is so very true, you do not 'see' anything. So much goes on around you, and you see only the outcome, never the battles, never what is really there. What do you want? I am growing tired of your company." The gold box in the albino's hand appeared to be giving off light of it's own.
"I came to concede to my opponent. I came to offer you the gift."
"You were never my opponent. Perhaps you were entertainment, but opponent? Ridiculous. What does this box do? Does it just whine like a frightened animal?" 
"Oh no, it does much more than that. Hold it up to your ear and listen."
"I suppose I'll play along. I am tired and there is nothing anyone can do to change things. I have nothing else to do at this moment. So yes, I'll play along," and the Warlock held the golden box to his ear. "I don't hear anything, priest."
"Longer, you have to hold it longer."
Again the albino raised the gold object to his ear. "Voices? Yes, I do believe so, yes I hear voices. They are so far away. What is this, holy man?"
"I told you, a gift. Listen closely to the voices, Listen to what they have to tell you."
The albino man looked at the minister coldly, then smiLed, "You are in no position to be giving me orders, Martin," yet he raised the object back to his ear.
The pastor had lowered his eyes from the glaring red irisds of the Warlock.
"Oh my, this is quite clever. I think I hear the voices calling my name. Is that correct, holy man?"
"Listen, Jonathan, listen."
"Yes, it is my name and something else, something. . .I can't quite make it out. It sounds like. . .come home? Yes, yes that's it, the voices are asking me to come home. What does it mean, priest?"
"Entertainment, simply entertainment, Jonathan. As I said, it is a gift, something to amuse you."
The albino stumbled.
The minister reached forward and steadied him. "You must be quite tired, Jonathan. Perhaps you should lie down?"
“No! And never place your hands upon me again! I have allowed you to live so far because you present no harm to me, because you could not harm me. But I will not allow you to touch me." The albino's voice turned to a whisper, "If you do so again I will kill you like the whores. Do you want to know what I did to them, holy man? Do you want to know?"
The minister remained silent.
"I fucked them and then cut their throats. One each night for the past thirteen. Would you like that minister, would you like me to fuck you and cut your throat?"
"I am sorry, Jonathan. I thought you might be falling. I will not make such a mistake again."
The Warlock had again raised the golden cube to his ear. "I think I can hear singing, preacher. Yes, singing, but different...musical but not...chanting? Could it be chanting?"
"I do not know, Jonathan. It could be, but I myself have never been fortunate enough to hear the songs of the cube. As I said, only the very powerful and privileéed can hear the songs."
The warlock fell to his knees.
The minister did not move forward.
"What's in the cube, preacher? What's in the cube?" The albino was drawing his breath as if his body was revolting refusing to allow the air to enter. His face had begun to take on a pale blue color of oxygen starved tissue.
"Captured souls, Jonathan. Captured souls like your own singing the songs of despair."
The warlock fell forward. His face pushed into the dirt below him. His body attempted several times to draw air but was unsuccessful.
"You were the fool, Jonathan. You were the destroyer and did not know. Instead you embraced some fantasy." The minister reached down and picked up the gold cube from the dead witch's hand.
"Now You are contained, Jonathan. At least for a time you are contained." The old man dragged the body of the Warlock over to where the corpses of the women had been left to decay. He walked back to where the conversation took place and picked up an oil lamp and opened the reservoir. The minister poured the oil over the bodies. He still allowed the wetted lamp wick to burn. He dropped the flame on the witches whose bodies ignited like cord wood. The fire was now just one of many which could be seen in the darkness.
A warm wind blew over him and the minister searched the sky for its source. For some reason he believed he was being watched. The wind again caressed his body, gently, so soft, so warm, whispers stroking his body. The minister pulled away from the delicate hands of the night wind and picked up the chalice and the golden cube. He carried them back close to the fire of flesh. He picked up a spade which had been laid close to the bodies but never used. The pastor began to dig.
Hours had past and a deep hole had grown from his effort. The minister placed the chalice and the cube into the fresh grave. He began a long and foreign sounding burial prayer, most of which was in Latin. He had finished his incantation before the wind began to caress him again.
The old man had become wet with the sweat of his work and the gentle wind began to dry him. He stopped momentarily and asked the black sky, "Who's there? I know something is there. Who's there?" The wind answered hay running her fingers over his tired body. 
The pastor finished burying the chalice and the soul of Jonathan Iverson sometime after the morning star began to raise in the west. The minister left no marker, no indication of a grave, for if the objects were unearthed, his deeds could be undone, Wul of the witch would unite with the destroyer once again.
Pastor Martin walked into the old cabin which had housed the obscene coven of evil. There on the table he found what he had been looking for, a book, a special book. On the table was a black leather bound volume entitled, The Book of the Destroyer. The old man picked up the heavy manuscript and carried it out of the shelter. As the dawn's first light began to crack the black sky, the old man worked his way down the steep embankment towards his home, the book tucked tightly under his arm.
He thought the wind appeared to be following him.
Once he arrived at his home, which had been mercifully spared by the fires, he quickly entered and locked the door.
He was so very tired. He had accomplished what had been asked of him, time and time again.
The minister laid the Book of the Destroyer with his others, thousands of volumes of rare and special books collected for centuries by the men of his family and now protected by him.
The old man heard the wind pulling at his window. He thought he heard voices saying, "Listen, listen, listen..."
As the hours passed, Martin became more of the wind, which was now pounding and shaking his small home, demanding entrance, demanding vengeance. Martin could tell the wind had changed, it was no longer soothing and kind, but rather was unnatural and vile. The wind which followed him was now cold on such a hot evening. The wind's presence was centered only around his house; Martin knew the wind carried the souls of Jonathan's witches and Martin knew they had come to claim him.
Martin knew the wind had come to claim his soul. Martin knew it was his time to die. He cursed the foul breezes, for he was not yet prepared for his death. There was so much more, so many more things to accomplish, and Martin no longer had time. He thought of his alternatives: The wind would sometime in the night claim his soul; of that he was sure. His other option was to wait, perhaps for all time, still he could wait, not within his body, but his essence could survive.
Martin possessed an enchanted toy, it was really not a toy at all, but rather a vehicle, a vehicle which and protect his soul for another time; for another battle. Martin did not believe he had other options to his current circumstance of fate. He knew he must use the toy, to become the container of his being. Perhaps, it was always meant to be this way; perhaps that was why he had never had a son.
Martin reached up to the top shelf of his bookcase. He removed several leather bound and heavy volumes and laid them upon the floor. His hands Were trembling. He then reached up into the space vacated by the book and pulled out a strange little stuffed animal. The toy appeared to be some kind of cross between a monkey and a bear, its eyes were polished mother of pearl, a smile had been permanently stitched upon its leather face. With the exception of the toy's palms and face, the little animal's entire body was covered with coarse hair: black horses hair.
"I guess now we wait, my little friend. Now we wait for the next time. I know a time of evil will again one day arise again." Martin held the toy close and stared into the animal's mother of pearl eyes. The eyes seemed to contain every color within the universe: there were shades of green and blue, reds and oranges, greys, yellows, black and white, and the colors appeared to be swimming and dancing within the toy's eyes. The blues merged with the reds and became green, the greens danced with the whites and greys, continuously; changing hues, swirling, moving and merging. Mairtin began to feel light headed, but did not drop the; toy, instead he focused more intensely upon the swirling, changing eyes of the little monkey—bear.
"Oh, your eyes are so very beautiful," he felt himself being pulled inside the talisman which could protect him forever. Martin said aloud, "Until the next time; until I am needed once more," he said and his body fell lifeless to the floor. His final breath escaped him. From outside his small house, the wind howled in despair and agony. Then the wind became quiet and all was still. The battle had ended for a time.

Chapter 3
Discovery
The small town was still deep within a cold winter's moirning slumber when seven construction workers unearthed the find. The men who found the ancient chalice were at the time more concerned with warding off the chill of the cold, which had climbed into their bodies, feeling like death, than with the golden chalice which now lay upon the frozen earth. The goblet, although made of solid gold, had lost its brilliance over the years and was as severely tarnished as inexpensive brass, the type of brass one might buy at a chain import store. A couple of the workers believed the goblet may not have been simply a relic of a retail store and could be of interest to the scientists and the archeologists in some far away ivory tower, some university. Places where no one really knew the meaning of real work, but like to think they; were important and necessary components to the world around them. None of the crew was about to go calling? any of those worthless college boys, they had better‘ things to do, like finishing this damn job for starters. The construction workers knew they had an excavation to complete and the sooner they were done, the sooner they would be able to warm themselves in the small construction shack.
 The chalice was thrown up upon the frozen mounds of dirt which had been growing in height like miniature mountains as the men's work progressed.
Richard Wagner was the man who found the goblet. The other men called him Dick and he hated it, due to the widely recognized nick name for Richard he had been the brunt of numerous jokes and cruelties throughout his childhood. He tried to have the other men call him Richard or Rick, but that didn't matter, he was always Dick, or dickface, or pencil dick, or any of the multitude of other vulgar variations of being Dick throughout his life. Sometimes he hated his parents; for not recognizing what he would have to put up with because of the name they had chosen for him. Once his wife, Kate called him Dick and he almost slapped her, even though she meant no harm, she simply knew others called her man the name and didn't recognize he was so touchy about it; she always called him Rick or Richard from that day forward.
When Richard found the chalice he thought it was old, very old, the other men didn't agree with him. Sammy Fontehell had said, "Hell, you know Rick, that if a piece of metal is buried for even a year or two it will look old, damn old. Once I found what I thought was a gold watch over on Sinclair Street. I took the darn thing home and polished on it for hours, until I saw Timex engraved on the back plate. Felt like a damn fool, I did, no reason for you to feel the same. That cup is probably no more than a year old, maybe two years at the most. Just toss the thing, it ain't worth nothing." Richard just smiled and nodded,  but placed the goblet in his lunch box when the other men weren't looking.
The men had accomplished what had to be done that day, they had moved more of that frozen earth than they really needed to in order not to piss off the foreman. So they stood around in the semi-warm construction shack and discussed the important things in life.
Leroy Evans wanted to know how many of the guys would be heading to the Poison Passion Lounge to tip a few after quitting time. It was really an unnecessary question, for almost entire crew went every night after work. It was a way to reward themselves for the hard work they had done that day and to forget that they would have to be back at it, digging and moving earth the next morning. Craig Brown offered to buy the first round, although he never did. Craig would drive around the block seven or eight times until the liquor was flowing like a spring run off and then make his entrance, cussing the guys out for not allowing him to buy. It was a ritual, and the other men knew it, but it allowed Craig to maintain some small segment of his pride so no one really ever got too worked up about his ploy. These men just did what they had to in order to get by, for they all lived hard lives. They needed to feed their wives and kids, or at least try, so they worked and worked very hard.
The crew didn't ask questions, they were the doers and not the deciders and that suited them just fine. These big men liked to have their expectations real clear.
The day drug on like some terminal illness, but finally the work day ended. The pickups and cars were loaded up and all the men, but Craig and Richard, made a line straight to the Passion.
Tonight was different than any night at the Poison Passion that the crew could recall. No one talked much and everyone of the men were through drinking by ten, a record in itself. Even so they all were very drunk.
Craig said, "You know we just worked too damn hard today. That son of a bitch, Mr. Foreman McKinney, could care less if we all died out there, as long as we reach the deadline. Jeez, that guy cares about us less than I care about some healthy bastard collecting welfare because he would rather stay home and watch perverts on talk shows. You know, who I'm talking about guys?"
"Your brother?" offered Leroy.
"No, smart ass, not my brother. You know, those weirdos, those fools who are always telling everyone how hard it is to be different on those TV shows. They never say they are weird or nothing, even though they make it with anything that moves. I even heard of one of those talk shows where the expert panel discussed making with it with the dead, pretty goddamn sick if you ask me."
"You should know, Brown," announced Leroy as he downed his fifth boiler maker.
"Leroy, those creeps just say that their perversion is due to the way the were born and raised. I guess that means their mamma was not a real nice person. Their mamma's probably made those fruits, perverts and that general class of scum dress up like women or farm animals. Shit who knows, they probably  breast fed until they were twelve." Craig's observation of the world around them was the first time that evening that most of the men laughed. Even though the laughter was different; it was forced and false.
"You know my wife watches those damn shows, she watched one on breast feeding and now all she does is sit around and lets the little one suck all day. She belongs to a club where the women get together and talk about how healthy breast feeding is for the child. I think they call it La Latch, or something like that," Red Treman volunteered.
"It's called the La Leche League, Red, " Sammy informed the group of men.
"I guess you Haitians know all about sucking, right Sammy?"
"Screw you, Red. The problem is that you just don't know a damn thing about anything. Which was probably a gift God gave you to try to keep you out of as much trouble as possible." Red stood up and squared off with Sammy.
"Sit your ass down, Red. We're a team, not enemies. You know we all got to work together every day, so just cool it," reasoned Craig.
"I'm still breast feeding. I'm not so sure the wife likes it, but I do. You know the stuff tastes like sweet cream. I probably enjoy it too much cause we got the skinniest damn baby around," Leroy informed his coworkers. Attempting to lighten up the situation, they all seemed so damn irritable, so intense. It was as if something was dragging on their minds.
Sammy, a Haitian, who was a mulatto, had relocated to the States after the death of his wife and daughters, told the guys, "I think that metal cup we dug up was something evil. I could feel it, I have been around long enough to know when something has some evil power wrapped up inside. That cup was wrong, it could have been trouble. Luckily, I had Dick toss the thing and that should be the end of it. But, I have to tell you, I didn't like that thing," Sammy looked down after his discloser.
Leroy told Sammy he was full of shit and that he got scared if they found some dead bird, or the moon became covered with a dark cloud. "It's, that damn voodoo shit that you got into before you came over to a civilized country. If you would stop putting pins into Barbie dolls and eating chicken heads you be a lot better off, " again there was a brief episode of laughter; again is sounded forced.
Richard did not show up to the Poison Passion that evening he had other things on him mind. He wanted to get home and show the chalice to Kate. He thought that she would see it was worth something and be quite proud of her husband's ability to sniff out some needed extra cash. Richard was feeling like he should be happy, hell he'd found what he was sure was some gold chalice, probably worth a thousand dollars or more, but instead he felt afraid. He couldn't explain it, but for some reason the idea of bringing the chalice into his home felt real bad, like bringing a porno movie about kids into his house: like the chalice would contaminate or dirty up his home, expose Kate and Philip to some true ugliness.
"Hell, that's just stupid thinking. There's nothing dirty or wrong about a cup. It's just a goblet, it's not like I'm supporting kiddy porn," he said to the interior of his car. Still the feeling did not go away.
When Richard pulled up into his driveway he thought for a moment about just leaving the goblet locked in the car. Then his mind said, "What if someone steals it?" and Richard said to his mind, "Yeah, what if someone steals it?" Although, he had been a life long resident of Lamont, and knew that no one stole anything from anyone in this small town, Richard concluded that he'd better get the chalice inside "So no one would steal it."
As he carried the chalice to his front door he held the goblet like it was a soiled diaper: with just the tips of his fingers and for a second he held his breath. No matter how many logical arguments he could manufacture about the chalice, he still couldn't get away from his feelings that it was dirty and that it was wrong.
His thought as he was turning the doorknob was, "No, not kiddy porn, it's more like holding a knife that someone used to cut up their family." Richard stepped into his living room holding the chalice.

Chapter Four
Midway
The stuffed animal sat high upon a shelf in back of the carnival barker. The animal was set above the beverage bottles which would determine the winners and the losers of this game of chance. The man, named Charles O'Brian, appeared to be very old and very tired. He was tired, but not that old. The stresses of his life weighed heavily upon him. Charles was the overseer of Rings and Bottles, a game in which the mark, the pigeon, the customer, would attempt to throw a ring over the top of one of the many bottles. The bottle which would win the stuffed animal was blue, it was the only blue bottle among hundreds and no one had ever been able to throw a ring around its neck. He had spent the better part of his life traveling around the country searching for the one to whom he would award the strange little toy, the little animal made from straw, leather and the hair of black horses.
The gamesman's heart quickened with each new crowd and in every new town as the carnival snaked its way across America. For some day, maybe not this year, the gamesman would find the one for whom he searched. Perhaps more accurately, the toy, the stuffed animal, that looked like a cross between a monkey and a bear, would find the one. And when that day came the gamesman would be through with his travels and his life's mission would be fulfilled. Of course there was always the possibility that his death would precede the ending of his quest, to find the one who must have the toy, but if that happened his apprentice would carry on the search in the same manner that he had done for his master.
The quest was greater than any man. The quest was to present the toy to the child who would face the one who possessed the Destroyer's will.
Many times the gamesman had wanted so badly to just give the toy to someone. On many occasions he had tried to do just that, he handed the strange looking stuffed toy to some lucky winner. - Even so, the next morning, when the games were over and the people were gone, he would go to the bottles and rings and there, high upon the shelf sat the little stuffed toy, the half monkey and half bear, watching and waiting, for the right one to take it home.
The toy had been with the carnival since its inception, close to one hundred years. No other carny knew of its purpose, no one but Charles. At times the gamesman would hold the strange form. He would look upon the button eyes made from mother of pearl. He would run his hands over the horsehair which covered the toy's body. He would smell the old and dried straw. Twice over his lifetime he had changed the straw stuffing; both times the little animal had gotten wet in some terrible rain. The gamesman hoped that he would never again have to change the stuffing, he hoped that he died before such a task needed to be completed again. When the gamesman had taken the straw from within the leather body of the toy, he felt as though he had placed his hands within a mass of living snakes. Horror had held him as tightly as a new mother will hold her child and he could smell death's breath beside him, when he reached into the body of the stuffed toy.
No, not again, he prayed never again.
The gamesman knew that the toy contained a soul.
Whose, he did not know and that did not matter. The gamesman knew that the monkey-bear was'sorfimery powerful; something very old and something that would one day become important. As night fell upon the small carnival and the lights danced upon the rides and games of chance, the old man would feel that anxious anticipation as he searched the crowds, once again, for the one. Charles knew that the stuffed toy which sat upon his shelf was doing the same.
(2)
"Step right up! Win a prize! Everyone's a winner," Charles barked to the mass of people who walked the midway.
(3)
When Richard arrived home from work that evening he desperately wanted to work on the chalice. He showed his
find to Kate~-his wife of nine years-—who was not overly impressed, and then to Philip--his four year old son—~who wanted the cup so he could go out and dig for bugs. Richard concluded that his family was not as enthusiastic about his find as he had been.
"Honey, I think I'm going to take this cup downstairs, clean it up and see what it looks like, " Richard told his wife.
"Oh, no you don't. Tonight's the carnival over in Fairdale and you know we ta ke Philip every year."
He had forgotten. "Yeah, I guess it will wait until we get home." Richard had picked up his son.
"Philip, my boy, are you ready to go ride the roller coasters, eat as much candy as you can and have more fun than you've ever had in your life?"
"OK, Daddy. Me want to go have fun."
"I bet you do," and the three of them had started to laugh.
(4)
The roller coaster touched the sky. The merry-go-round horses raced the wind. The cotton candy was like eating a piece of a captured cloud, and the little family of Richard, Kate and Philip Wagner couldn't have been having a better time. Then Richard found the Rings and Bottles game on the Midway.
"Hey, Kate, I was always good at that game. Let me give it a try," Wichard. in"
"OK, see if you can win a toy for Philip, " Kate responded.
Richard paid the gamesman, paid Charlie O'Brian. Charles put three wooden rings on the counter. "OK, what you want to do is throw one of these rings over one of the bottles. The colored bottles are for the big prizes, the clear ones are for a small, and if you don't get a ring over a bottle, you still win a prize. Everyone wins, every time." Charles went through his pitch like a talking computer, the words were all there, but not much else. Charlie was still searching the crowd. The little monkey—bear on the top shelf appeared to be looking at Philip.
Richard threw the first ring. It bounced off the bottles and quickly fell to the ground. He threw the second ring. It copied the first.
"This isn't the game I was thinking of," Richard had turned and informed Kate. She could see that Richard wasn't going to win any prizes tonight.
"Let Philip throw the last one," she said, and Richard handed the wooden ring to his son.
"Try to throw the ring on top of one of the bottles, sport," Richard said as he picked up his son so that he could have a good view of the game.
"OK, Daddy. Me win you a prize, " and Philip threw the ring.
It hit the clear bottles, bounced up into the air as both of Richard's rings had, but then instead of falling to the ground the ring fell onto the top of a bottle, the blue bottle.
Philip smiled.
Charles stopped breathing for a moment.
Kate yelled, "You won, Philip. You won!"
Richard hugged the little boy, kissing him on the cheek. "What does he get?" Richard asked the gamesman.
Charlie didn't respond verbally, but with shaking hands he reached to the top shelf and pulled down the monkey—bear.
"Oh, gross," said Kate, "can't he have something that's new. That looks like an old piece of cow hide or something, not a toy."
"Sugar Bear!" screamed Philip, pulling free from Richard's arms and grabbing the stuffed toy from the gamesman. The little boy hugged the animal like a lost but now found security blanket: with passion and relief.
"I love Sugar Bear," announced Philip, smiling up at his parents and hugging the toy.
"That's the prize for the blue bottle," said the gamesman,
"There is no other prize."
"Can't he pick something else?" asked Kate.
"No, that's the prize for the blue bottle," the man repeated, "and I'm closed for the rest of the night." The tarpaulin dropped in front of them as the gamesman allowed the curtain to fall. Kate and Richard just stood there for a minute feeling shocked. Philip still hugged the little stuffed toy.
"Honey, can't we let him have it for awhile? I'll just take it out of his room one night after he's sleeping and go throw it away. It's not going to hurt him if he has the toy for a day or two. Let's go home." And they did.
(5)
After coming home from the bizarre little carnival, Kate and Richard took Philip up to bed. The small boy had yet to release the strange stuffed animal.
"Can Sugar Bear sleep with me?" asked Philip.
"Maybe it would be better if we had your bear sleep on the dresser," said Kate. 
"Oh, Mommy, please," the child pleaded.
"What if it's has germs on it or something?" Kate turned to her husband, "Richard, what if it's not clean?"
Richard leaned over and whispered to his wife, "It's OK honey, everything will be fine. I'm sure in a day or two Philip will forget all about the thing and then we'll just throw it out."
"Are you sure, Richard?"
"I'm sure, Kate," and he kissed her. When Richard looked back at his son, he had already fallen asleep. Philip held the toy tightly in his arms. He reached over for Kate's hand and led her into the bedroom.
"Let's leave his light on tonight," she said as the couple left their son's room. 
Once in their own bedroom, Richard locked the door.
"Don't do that, Honey. Philip's sleeping, don't lock the door," said Kate as she unbuttoned the yellow blouse she had worn that evening. 
"OK. Here, let me help you with that," and Richard came up from behind Kate and reached his arms around her. He kissed the back of her neck as he slowly released the buttons of her blouse. He allowed his hands to slip over her bra, feeling the warmth of her breasts, and then he ran his hands down her pants and released those buttons as well.
"It was a good night, wasn't it," Kate said as she leaned back against his body.
"Yes," he said as he helped Kate drop her clothes to the floor.
Before he removed his own clothes; before he took his wife to bed, Richard did something he had been doing for over nine years. He stepped back and looked at Kate's body; it still amazed him. Her dark brown hair with the red highlights, her blue eyes, her breasts which curved up so slightly, her right nipple slightly darker than the left, the freckles on her shoulders--everything. She was perfect as far as he was concerned. Richard took a deep breath and then stepped forward, having removed his own clothes. He allowed his lips to brush across Kate's lips and then moved his head down to her breasts. Kate's nipples had hardened with his touch.
"You make my legs feel all shaky," she said and Kate draped her arms around him. "Take me to bed, lover." Richard thought that as the years passed, their lovemaking had only gotten better. Kate was no longer the shy little receptionist down at Mill Creek Lumber, instead she was his wife, his partner and they shared each other with no hesitation, a total commitment and that single mindedness of purpose.
Richard lifted Kate and carried her to their bed. He placed her upon the mattress and rested his body on top of her's. He kissed her, at first gently and then allowed his passion to dictate. Kate returned his kisses and the two began a lover's dance. Richard allowed his hands to explore Kate's body. Their touches a communication of their excitement and desire. Richard kissed the softness of her neck, her belly and her inner thighs. Kate allowed herself to become lost in the sensations of pleasure, running her fingernails over her husband's back. Tonight as Richard slid himself into Kate's body that merging of body and soul occurred, that merging where it was difficult to tell who was who and if boundaries existed between them, those lines dissolved with their passion.
As Richard and Kate meet her man they both reached that peak where fireworks exploded in their brains. After a final kiss, Kate rolled to her side and within several minutes was sleeping deeply. Richard had hoped that he too would be provided with a deep and restful sleep, but after close to an hour of staring at the ceiling and thinking about the chalice, he got out of bed.
"Sleep well, love," he said, kissing Kate on her forehead. Richard dressed and went downstairs——stopping briefly to look at his son, who still held the strange bear, but was sleeping soundly.
(6)
Once he had retrieved the chalice, the first thing that Richard did was to get some cleaner, a couple of polishing cloths and went to work in the basement. He spent the next five hours polishing the chalice: cleaning off the debris which had bonded to the metal over time. Little by little he made progress, first he became aware of little spots of gold metal where the tarnish was removed.
Around three in the morning, when the world is at its lowest ebb and the sound of a single car weaving down the road sounded like thunder in a bad summer storm, Richard had over half of the goblet polished and had begun to uncover a host of strange symbols. He hoped that within the next hour or two he would uncover all the writings. He kept thinking of what Sammy had said and he prayed the letters were not some form of oriental language which indicated the chalice was made in Taiwan or Pakistan. Rick's hands hurt, and where they did not provide him with pain they had gone numb. However, Richard was determined, obsessed with finding out about more about this goblet. So in the middle of the night he kept polishing and removing the tarnish and dirt, attempting to find out what was hidden underneath.
At five in the morning as the sun climbed over the horizon, Richard had removed enough of the grime to see what was written on the chalice.
INSERT CHALICE WRITING
"Great," said Richard to the empty basement. The letters, or whatever they were didn't give him a clue. He still could not tell if it was old, but he did believe the chalice was made of gold. The color was yellow brown, the same as his wedding band. And he had the strong belief that the goblet was solid, for if it was not, he suspected that there would be small chips or changes of color which would have indicated to him that the cup was plated. The goblet was solid in color and heavy, the symbols which were etched into the chalice indicated that the object was really a find and probably worth more than he made in a month, for the etchings were at least a quarter of an inch deep and the metal was still gold.
Richard decided that he was a lucky man. He spent the next hour working on the remaining tarnish and when he was through the chalice gave off the glow of autumn aspens.
Richard carried the gold goblet back up stairs and placed the artifact on the mantle above the fireplace. He went up. to the bedroom where Kate was sleeping; dressed in his work clothes and kissed his wife. Kate was still sleeping soundly when he went out to drive to work. He felt physically tired but his mind was on fire. His thoughts were racing. The goblet was a mystery, Richard had experienced few mysteries in his life, and now he was determined to discover what the strange chalice was, where it was from, how old was the piece and what it had been used for. Being a laborer he did not have the opportunity to use his mind much, his work was very physical, but also very boring. He was smiling as he drove to the construction site for he believed he was on the beginning of a wonderful adventure.
Several hours later Kate awoke and descended the stairs to the living room. She saw the goblet on the mantle and thought to herself, "Well it looks expensive or special, maybe Rick really did find something that could be worth some extra money." Kate had been wanting to get a new refrigerator, as the old classic they had been given by some relative caused them a considerable amount of trouble; particularly in the summer months when the old compressor had to work harder than it was really capable. Kate knew the old appliance had seen its better days and it couldn't be before the couple could not put off buying another one. In fact she expected the old ice box to die any day now.
Philip had awakened and was yelling for his mom. She stood looking at the goblet a few seconds longer and then climbed back up the stairs to bring little Philip down for some breakfast.
"You still got that thing, huh?" Kate asked her son, pointing at the stuffed animal.
"Mommy, me love Sugar Bear. Don't you?" Philip was jumping down the stairs one at a time, holding the stuffed animal by one of its hairy arms.
"I don't know, honey. Your bear looks pretty old. Maybe he's too old to be a toy anymore," she said hoping the ploy would be effective.
"Nope, Sugar Bear likes being my toy. He told me he did."
Kate thought, "Oh great, now it talks, I know we'll never be able to get rid of that damned thing. Jeez, the kids already as bad as his father, gets all excited with something that looks old." But she said to her boy, "OK, come on Champ,let's get some work done today, and she held Philip's other hand and the two of them jumped down the rest of the stairs, one at a time.
Kate became involved in her daily routine of making the house look presentable, she prepared Philip a breakfast-~Fruitloops, orange juice and toast, which Philip devoured as quickly his favorite candy—~and played with the small boy. She pretty much forgot all about the chalice.
After lunch she placed Philip back into bed for an afternoon nap, a needed break for the both. Of course Philip had to take Mr. Hairy—Dirty-Animal with him. As she came down again to the living room to watch one of the two soaps she followed, she again noticed the goblet on the mantle. Kate went over to where the chalice set above the fireplace and saw the writing on the cup. It frightened her, but Kate did not understand why, she thought, "It sure looks like gold and that's as good as money in the bank. I'm sure Richard will find someone to buy it. After all, he knows how much we need other things, practical things." Kate backed away from the goblet and moved to the couch to watch an episode of Yesterday's Gone. She turned up the volume and became vicariously involved in today's TV tragedies. As the day's soap episode ended, Philip announced that his nap time was over with a loud entrance into the living room.
"How about you help with dinner, Big Guy?" Kate asked her.young boy.
"We cook cookies?" asked Philip.
"Not today, Honey. I'm going to make chicken."
"OK, me help," Philip replied.
Philip helped by pulling everything out of the cabinet he was capable of and then, once he became bored, hanging on his mother's leg, demanding to be held.
Kate did not pick up the toddler immediately for her hands were covered with grime and grease from skinning the chicken. Philip tired of pulling on his mother's leg and headed off out of the kitchen to explore for a while, dragging Sugar Bear behind him. Kate could hear her son playing in the living room, taking everything off the coffee table and then she heard the boy scream. Kate thought that her son must have stuck a pen into a electrical outlet or something, she knew her son's cries, screams and other calls for help and this one sounded desperate. She ran to the living room and saw Philip pointing up at the chalice on the mantle, the little boy was saying something that sounded like, "onster blood" and continued to repeat the words, "Mommy, onster blood, onster blood, kill me."
She rapidly interpreted, and questioned the child, "Monster blood, kill me? Is that what you said Philip?" "Yes, onsters in that glass," said the small child.
"No, honey, that is just a cup that your daddy found at work. It's nothing to be afraid of, " she said as she picked up the boy.
Kate carried her son over to the mantle and picked up the chalice, "See...," the goblet was filled with fluid, thick fluid which was a brown-red color. Kate knew what the cup contained, but smelled the contents anyway and then was positive. She screamed and dropped the goblet to the floor.
 The blood spilled from the chalice and was rapidly absorbed by the carpet, leaving an ugly red stain. 
"Onster blood, Mommy. Kill me." There were tears of fear in both the mother's and son's eyes. Over in the corner sat the little monkey—bear, its eyes had begun to glow.
Chapter Five
Excavation
The crew arrived at the site the next morning at six a.m. They all looked very tired or very hung over, it was difficult to tell which. Richard was the only one who appeared in good spirits and ready to work. The other men were very slow and demonstrated considerable difficulties getting going. It took Red over thirty—five minutes to get the big D-9 Cat started, something that usually required about the same amount of time to start as a temperamental car, several minutes some mornings and other days the earth mover would turn over and be moving immediately. One could never tell what kind of mood the machine would be in on any given day. Red said it was the cold, that diesels were warm blooded. This morning no one believed him. It was apparent that the heavy equipment operator was stalling.
Sammy walked over to Richard who was smiling and getting his tools ready for the day.
"Hey, Richard, you didn't take that brass cup home, did you?"
"No, I was thinking about what you said about the watch. I decided I didn't want to waste my time. Why do you want to know anyway?"
"Well, this is kind of strange, but after we left the bar last night, I thought I would come back and take a look at it again. You know I could have been wrong and maybe it was worth something. Well, I got back here around eleven and looked around for the thing until after three. Never could find it. I thought that if maybe it was worth something that you and I could take the thing down to Center Street Pawn. I know old Stan Berg pretty well and he'd give us a fair price, then we could split the cash."
Richard just said, "Yeah, well, it's got to be in one of those piles of frozen dirt over there, that's were I tossed it," But Richard was thinking, "You son of a bitch, you knew it was worth something all the time and that watch story was just something to have me dump the thing so you could claim it as your prize." Richard smiled, "Maybe on our lunch break you can take another look for the thing. I really don't want it. Let me know if you get any cash for it or if it really was worthless."
"Rich, if I find the cup, I'll still split any cash I get with you, after all you're the one who found it," Sammy told Richard.
Richard thought, "Right, and if you could find it, which you won't, you take that gold glass down, get a couple of hundred and then come back and tell me it was worthless, just like you thought in the first place." Richard said, "That's damn nice of you, Sammy. I hope you do find it," and Richard smiled again.
The men finally got into the swing of the job, the typical talking, cutting each other down and the daily play, such as tossing dirt clods at each other, or looking one of the men into the portable toilet, just didn't happen today. There minds and bodies were focused on getting this damn job done and moving on to some new location. Ever since the golden cup was found, this excavation just seemed like a bad place. 0f course, none of the men said so, for they didn't wish to be the brunt of the jokes at the Poison Passion that evening. No one wanted to hear lines like, "Oh, good Buddy, I knew that wife of yours was a bitch, but I didn't know she cut your balls off. I guess it's time you started using the ladies room down at the Passion." These workers prided themselves on being men and part of being a man meant you weren't afraid of anything, let alone a old goblet.
As the morning wore on as slowly as waiting in line to buy Kotex for one of their wives at the corner grocery store, the first accident happened. Red was backing the Cat up to get a good run at large bolder which they had uncovered and Leroy was standing with his back to the large machine. From some reason, that no one could explain, the backup warning beeper wasn't sounding today and Leroy didn't hear a thing.
Red backed right into him, the impact didn't kill him but broke his right leg in three places, compound fracture. As Leroy laid on the ground gritting histeeth and biting his inner lip, to keep from screaming out in pain. Red jumped off the cat and saw Leroy was going to be OK.
"Why you lucky son of a bitch, Leroy. It looks like you broke your leg, the home's sticking out, but hell, that's you'll be table to sit at home and watch those perverts on the TV and get paid for it. Shit, I should be so lucky." Leroy didn't feel lucky at all, his leg hurt, he was cold and he wondered if he would ever walk again. He tried to smile, but was afraid he would throw up instead. Richard had walked across the street to call an ambulance. When he returned, Craig said, "Hell, he don't need no ambulance. I'll take him down to the company doc and he'll be fixed up as good as new in no time." Craig was looking for a way to get off the site, he wasn't a particularly compassionate man, just lazy and scared.
"Richard, I think I better go to the hospital. I don't want to go to the company doc, he'll just give me some pills and tell me to wait and see if it's feeling any better in the morning."
Richard agreed, once he had smashed his thumb in a work related accident and went to the old company doc, who smiled at him and said, "Well, I guess we'll just cut it off. It's smashed too bad to heal right anyway. Besides, a thumbs worth over a thousand in comp. You ready?" Richard decided he liked his thumb and stood and left the company doc's office, went home and got drunk. Now his thumb looked like shit but it still worked, the thousand would have been long gone by now.
"I'll see you get to the hospital, Leroy."
"Thanks Richard."
Richard thought it was ironic that everyone on the crew knew his "real" name when they needed something, like a ride home, some excuse for being somewhere other than home, money for another drink——whatever. Sometimes he really hated the bastards he worked with, he guessed he just wasn't really one of them. But then, he wasn't really sure he wanted to be.
The ambulance arrived approximately five minutes after the call. The paramedic looked a Leroy, took his Vitals, examined the broken leg, placed an inflatable cast on Leroy's leg and then the driver and paramedic loaded him into the ambulance. Before they left the paramedic looked at the crew who were standing around the emergency vehicle and said, "Who ever called us probably saved this guys life, as bad as this break is he sure as shit would have gone into shock and probably died. Good work guys," and the paramedic closed the back of the ambulance and the vehicle took fo rlmnjng full sirens and lights to the hospital.
"Those guys don't know shit, old doc could have fixed him up fine," said Craig. Richard just looked at him like he was some sort of vermin.
It was less than an hour after lunch when the next accident occurred. Craig was running the back-hoe when he raised the hydraulics to high and the hoe broke free. Two thousand pounds of steel busted like a dry tree limb and came to earth like an unarmed bomb. Unfortunately, the broken hydraulics shot forward and severed Craig's arm. Red lost it when he saw the arm laying on the frozen dirt and started screaming.
"His arm came off! His fucking arm just came off!" Sammy slapped Red across the face and Red punched Sammy in the chest. The two men were fighting like male cats after a female in heat as Craig sat perfectly still in what was left of the back—hoe, his life's blood draining and mixing with the old oil which puddled on the machine's platform. Again, Richard came to the scene of the accident, pulled Craig from the machine and raised the stub of what was left of his arm above his head. Richard pulled his belt off and wrapped it tightly around the stump, it didn't seem to do much good, blood still was shooting out of the end of the stump and covering them both like some obscene shower.
"Call another fucking ambulance," Richard yelled at the two fighting men. That appeared to grab their attention momentarily and Sammy ran over to a Chinese restaurant to summon help. It didn't matter, by the time the ambulance arrived Craig had lost more blood than a stuck pig. He died on route to the hospital.
The remaining men stood around shaking and shivering, more from shock than the cold. The police arrived at the scene several minutes later than the emergency team. They asked many questions, such as, "Did anyone see what happened? Had any of the crew ever had trouble with the hoe before? Was Craig liked by the other men?" And so on. 
McKinny, the foreman, showed up after another fifteen minutes or so, he tried to act like he was deeply concerned with the other men's welfare. His act was as false as a murder's empathy. It was apparent that the crew's boss was just plain pissed off that there was no way in hell they would meet the deadline, and McKinny was sure he would catch flying shit balls when his "superiors" discovered what had occurred at excavation site 223. As McKinny was found of saying, maybe he didn't do the work, but he took the responsibility. It was hard to say which was more difficult. McKinny was sure he would be answering want ads for building foreman within a day or two. After all he had missed the deadline, for which his company would be fined-—no bonuses this time around——and he would be blamed for using faulty equipment, even though he didn't have a damn thing to do with selection or maintenance of the construction equipment.
Richard was in a semi-daze after what had happened to Craig. He wandered around aimlessly, looking at the ground they had uncovered and then he saw another relic. Again this artifact appeared to be an old piece of brass, mostly because of the color: green tarnish. What Richard found this time was not a goblet, but rather it was simply a box, square and approximately two inches by two. The object reminded him of one of those mind cubes that he could never do, unless he peeled the colors off and placed them in the right positions. Richard picked up the cube and wondered if the crew had uncovered some ancient grave site, but in the Midwest? In Lamont, a small town whose only claim to fame was that once a small time country singer had performed there as a charity act to assist the town in building a fundamentalist church? He remembered Sammy's comments, and even though the Haitian had come back looking for the goblet, the best bet was still that some trinket store had gone under and left the replicas to be buried along with the demise of some little shop. The other option was that the crew had found treasure. He thought that the chalice he had found was gold, but shit, the likelihood that they were digging around in some ancient treasure bed was about as logical as taking a piss into the wind.
Anyway, Richard picked up the little box, placed the thing in his lunch box and didn't say a word to any of the other crew members.
McKinny to Richard, "Hey, Wagner, your wife called and said she needed you home right away. You might as well take off the rest of the day. We sure as hell aren't going to get any more work done and besides you can count on having some new boss to oversee your work in a day or two, so what the hell do I care. Get out of here and go see what the problem is."
Richard wondered what had happened at home, when he was hit with the words, "chalice, chalice, chalice." He shook free of the thought and replaced his fear by thinking, "Probably a water pipe broke or something," still, he ran towards his car. The other men were standing around, denying blame for what had happened that day.
Sammy ran up to Richard before he got to his car and said, "Throw that box away, Rich. I told you this was a bad place, something’s wrong here, real wrong. Maybe we're digging around in some ancient grave or something."
"What are you talking about? What box?"
"Games aren't going to do any of us any good. Let me be straight with you, I didn't come back here last night to see if I could find the goblet and try to pick up some extra money. I know omens, and I know bad omens, that goblet you found was one. I came back looking for the damn thing hoping I could destroy it before someone picked it up. I know you have it, Richard and, as long as you do, bad things will happen, to you and to your family. Destroy them Richard, if you can, it might already be too late." Sammy slowed to a walk; Richard kept running.
When he arrived at the old Omni he saw the same symbols or words or what ever written on the windshield as were carved into the goblet:


"That damn Haitian is just trying to scare me into giving him the gold." He rubbed the letters off the car's glass and opened the door and headed toward home. After about ten minutes, his hands started to burn, like he had been messing around with battery acid. Richard came to a red light and examined his hands, the skin was peeling from his palms.
"That Bateen is pulling every trick in the book to have me hand over the gold. Well no way, my family needs the cash as much as he does. If I know Kate, she had probably already picked out some new appliance and just wants my approval. We'll get whatever she wants. I never have been able to provide her with all I wanted too, maybe now I can." The skin on Richard's hands continued to peel. He pulled a large piece of skin off his hand, "Fuck it," he said and drove faster, speeding towards home.
As Richard pulled into the single driveway of his tract home, everything looked quiet and in order. He walked up the small walkway to the front door and entered. The first thing that he was aware of was the crying. Not only the his son crying, but his wife also. Richard began to run, moving as quickly as he could to the sound, the sound of terror coming from his living room. When he arrived he saw both his wife and son, who was in his mother's arms staring at the goblet lying upon the floor.
"Oh my God, Richard what happened to you?" Kate stepped toward her husband.
"Nothing, OK” what's happening here?"
"Blood, Richard, the cup was filled with blood, " Kate told him.
Richard saw the golden goblet, the chalice laying on the carpet. He felt something eating at his insides, it was not panic, or terror, but rather the dead feeling he had experienced earlier that afternoon when he saw Craig's arm lying on the dirt at site 223. He thought of the golden cube he had found today, which was still outside in the Omni, still in his lunch bucket. He looked at the peeling skin on his hands, the blood of co—worker which covered his shirt and arms. Richard looked at the little monkey-bear sitting in the corner. It was then that Richard began to feel afraid, really afraid.
As they stood there surrounded by silence, Richard, Kate and Philip were all trembling as if they had just come in from the cold.
Chapter Six
Poison Passion
The silence was broken when Kate asked, "Richard, what happened to your hands? Is that blood?" She felt like she was going to fall over and braced herself with one arm against the wall, holding Philip with the other.
Richard told her. He told her about Leroy and about Craig. He told her that Sammy must have put battery acid on his windshield and that when he rubbed it off with his hands the skin began to peel. He didn't say anything about the cube in his lunch pail.
"It's that damn cup," she said pointing to the gold chalice on the floor.
"How do you know that, women's intuition?" Richard
asked her.
"No, common sense, Rich. All this has happened since you brought that thing home."
"Onster blood," added Philip.

The news of Craig Brown's death and Leroy Evans trip to the hospital arrived at the Poison Passion Lounge long before the crew did. It was one of those small mysteries in life no one really understood. If someone were to press Pete Johnson, the bartender, or Mary Sue Franklin, the Lounge's cocktail, waitress, how they found out about the tragedies at site 223, they would have been hard pressed to remember. But deep down within their beings they both knew. Such mysteries of communication were something to think about, but rarely were, instead they were just accepted. Pete had opened three new bottles of Canadian and stocked the cooler with beer when he found out. Mary Sue had walked back to the women's room and cried for a good three minutes before cleaning her face and re—applying her mascara.
When the crew walked into the Passion that evening the place went as silent as a professional criminal during an interrogation.
"Real sorry to hear about Craig," said Pete looking at Red and Sammy.
The two men nodded and sat down at the bar followed by the rest of the crew. Pete placed boilermakers in front of all the men and then waved off any attempts to pay for the drinks. The crew drank in silence for a good twenty—five minutes before anyone said a word. Finally, Red looked at Sammy and said, "I still keep seeing his fucking arm. You know I just can't get it out of my head."
Bill Barnett, who spoke about as often as snow storms in July said, "It was that cup we dug up that is responsible."
Sammy and Red looked at him in surprise and it was a good thirty minutes and four drinks later before the conversation picked up again.
"Where is Dick, anyway?" Red asked. "This makes two nights in a row he ain't come to the Passion. He should be here with us, it just ain't right."
"The boss sent him home early. Something about a problem at home," Sammy informed the crew.
"Oh shit," said Bill and everyone got quiet again.
(3)
Richard and Kate had tried to eat their fried chicken dinner but the day‘s events made it"all but impossible. Richard started to tear the meat off a leg and had to spit it out on his plate.
"Isn't it done?" asked Kate.
"No, it's fine. I just don't think I can eat tonight."
Kate placed her hand on his shoulder and then stood and cleared the table. Philip had tossed all the food off his high chair and then just sat there staring at his parents.
"Richard, what are we going to do?"
"About what? "
"Don't give me that, you know something’s wrong as well as I do. You have to get rid of that goblet. I'm telling you it was filled with blood this afternoon. I saw it."
"Then what happened to the blood? You said you dropped the chalice on the carpet and it spilled all over the place. When I got home there was nothing but the goblet on the carpet," replied Richard.
"Where did you ever hear the word, chalice?" she asked him.
Richard looked around the kitchen, placed his hands on the table, "I don't know, maybe in school or something."
Kate didn't look at him and began cleaning up the floor where Philip had thrown his food. "Richard, I'm scared."
"Me too, sugar. Me too."
"Richard, would you put that thing out in the garage or something? I really don't like it being in the house."
He didn't respond verbally, but stood up from the table and went into the living room. The chalice still lay on the carpet. Richard walked over and picked up the goblet. He approached the cup like it was a live wire, expecting to be shocked or something when he touched it, but nothing, just the texture of smooth metal in his hand. "This is just stupid,” Richard thought to himself, "It's just an old cup, that's all. Hell, things happen, construction is a dangerous business, everyone knows that. Today was just one of those days when everything's wrong." He walked out to the Omni to place the chalice in his lunch pail with the gold box. When he came back to the house, he did something people don't do in Lamont. Richard Wagner locked his front door.

Back at the Poison Passion, Pete Johnson was pouring drinks faster than when he moonlighted as a bartender at the free bars set up for weddings or wakes. The men appeared to be attempting to drown themselves in alcohol, searching for a drunkenness which would cloud the day’s events, with little success.
Red was significantly lubricated and begin to ask some questions concerning the possibility of site 223 being cursed or the accidents having something to do with the gold cup. "Sammy, I know you got some experience in curses and that evil stuff back in Cuba or whatever, before you came to the States. What do you think is happening?"
"That's Haiti, not Cuba, Red," Sammy informed him.
"Well, wherever, I knew it was one of those Mexican islands where the people do magic stuff. Just tell me what you think?"
"Red, I don't think that what has been happening is because of that damn cup. I know what is happening is because of goblet. When I was a young boy, back home there were people who did voodoo stuff, like place curses on people and other things." Sammy hesitated and thought, "And I was one of them." He focused again on the crew, "You know those walking dead, Zombies, that everyone thinks are some kind of joke or something. Well, I've seen them, Red and they are real. I don't think that the goblet has anything to do with voodoo, it's something much worse and much older than that. It reminds me of some of the things my grandmother used to
talk about when I was a little kid. Really bad stuff, from far away countries. . .anyway, I could feel the evil coming off that thing when Rich found it. That kind of evil feels like being in a cloud of smoke, it makes your head spin and then it's hard to think. I don't know what the cup means, and I 'm not real sure that I want to. But, I do know that the thing has power and that power is evil it's bad news, real bad news." Sammy finished his response and drained a CC and seven in two long swallows.
"Well, what do we do about it, Sammy? Is there some way to get rid of the thing, destroy it or something? Some way to make it not dangerous anymore?" Red asked, normally he would be telling Sammy he was so full of shit that you could smell it on his breath. Not tonight, Red was as frightened as the rest of the crew and was willing to listen to anything.
"Red, the way I figure it, that goblet was buried on purpose. I know you don't know this, but Rich picked up another relic, a gold box, earlier today. It used to be common practice to take containers of evil, like the cup and the box and then bury then in ground blessed by a priest or some other religious man. By blessing the earth the evil was contained, trapped under ground, until we dug it up. We need to do the same, Red. We need to get the goblet and box back from Rich and that ain't going to be easy, because he thinks they are worth big bucks. But, we got to figure out a way to do that and then get those damn things buried again, where they can't do any harm."
(5)
After Richard returned to the kitchen, Kate had cleaned up the dinner dishes and had gotten Philip into his Mutant Turtle sleeper. The little boy was smiling for the first time since Richard arrived home.
"Time for bed, little guy," Richard told the boy and lifted him up and looked into his eyes.
"Big hug and kiss, Daddy," requested Philip, and Richard obliged his son, hugging him hard and kissing him on the check. "One for Sugar Bear too?" asked Philip, once again holding the toy in his arms.
"No, I don't think Sugar Bear likes kisses," said Richard.
"Sure he does, Daddy”
"Well, OK,“ Richard kissed the heat toy, pulling his mouth away he thought, "God does that thing smell awful." He looked into Philip's eyes and said, "Let's go read a story. Sound good, sport?"
The small boy verified his support of the idea with another wide smile. Richard and his son started up the stairs.
"Richard, could we have Philip sleep with us tonight?" asked Kate.
"Kate, I know it's been a real bad day, but if we let him it could put him into the habit and then we would never get him out of our bed. Besides, look at him now, he doesn't seem scared anymore."
"Just tonight, Richard," Her eyes looked ready to tear.
"OK, just tonight. But tomorrow I'm selling that gold and then hopefully things can get back to normal."
"Richard, I know Craig wasn't married, but would you like me to call Leroy's wife and see how she's doing?"
"Let's give them a day or two, I'll find out how things are tomorrow at work."
"OK, " she said and followed her husband up the stairs. "You put that damn goblet outside somewhere, didn't you, Rich?"
"Yeah, I locked it in the car."
(6)
Red suggested that Sammy, Bill, and he go on over to Dick's house and get that damn gold cup and the other thing he found.
"Red, I know what I said about the goblet, but whatever happened today is over. I don't think Rich will leave those things at home, he will bring them to work tomorrow. We can get him to understand, then we can bury the things again."
"Well, if you ask me, the sooner we get this done the better," Red said, downing another drink. 
Actually, Sammy agreed with him, and if the crew hadn't been downing the alcohol like it was the last night of their lives, he probably would have gone along. However, Sammy knew that bad things happen when people drink too much, accidents, fights and the like. Sammy wasn't willing to give the chalice a favorable condition, an edge, no matter how ridiculous that sounded.
"We'll do 'er in the morning, Red, and then that will be the end of it," Sammy finished his drink and said, "I'm going home, I've had more than my share tonight and we do have to work in the morning whether we like it or not." Sammy stood and walked out the front door of the Poison Passion.
Red looked over at Bill and said, "I still keep seeing Craig's fucking arm, man. It was just laying there on the dirt like some prop from a horror movie. Jez, even with all the joy juice I put down my pipes tonight I still ain't going to sleep. Maybe I'll take a bottle home and just drink till I pass out."
Bill looked over at Red and said, "I don't know if it would be a good idea to sleep tonight anyway." Pete Johnson thought he might be hallucinating. In all the years he had worked the Passion, he could count the words 01' Bill had said on the fingers of both hands, tonight he sounded like a philosopher. Pete thought about it long into the night and decided that bars are sometimes a cosmic place, people say things which they would never say, things happen that shouldn't. As he was finishing—cleaniwthe mess in themre someone who had overindulged puked all over the floor, Pete decided bars weren't really cosmic after all, they just happened to be filled with drunks who happened to be unpredictable.

Richard and Kate had been sleeping several hours when Philip began to cry. His mom picked the small child up and held him tightly.
"What's the matter, Philip?"
"The onster cups back, Mommy, it's in my 'oom, "
"You just had a bad dream, honey. There's nothing to be scared of. Your daddy put the cup outside, promise."
The little boy looked at his mother's eyes and the fear appeared to drain from his face. Kate held him until he fell back to sleep."
Richard who had just fallen asleep after trying for hours was awakened by his son's cries. He rolled to his side allowing Kate to take care of the situation, but thought, "Figures, as soon as I fell asleep the little shit would ruin it for me. I told that bitch we should have made him sleep in his own bed." These thoughts were as foreign to Richard as living in some large eastern city would have been. However, he rationalized, "I'm just so tired, that's all and with everything that happened today, well I guess I'm just not myself." Still, Richard felt guilty, he deeply loved his wife and son, they meant the world to him. He sat up in bed and looked over at his family, "Everything OK?" Kate nodded, placed a finger over her lips to quiet him and smiled as the child drifted back into the blackness of slumber.
Richard lay back down on the bed and rolled again to his side. He felt cold and wet, perspiration was standing out on his skin like droplets of freezing rain. He felt more afraid than at anytime since this whole thing began. Richard kept feeling like he should get up and lock himself in the bathroom, away from his family. For some reason, he didn't trust himself. He laid awake until dawn the blackness Several minutes before the alarm would have awakened him, if he had been sleeping, he turned off the buzzer, got out of bed and dressed for work. He kissed his wife and son and went out to his car without breakfast. He was aware that as he attempted to place the key into the door lock to open the Omni's door, his hands were shaking badly. He ended up using both hands, one to steady the other to open the car door. He saw his lunch pail still sitting on the back seat, which was clasped tightly closed. Richard was grateful for that and he started the car and began the fifteen minute drive down to excavation site 223.
(8)
When Richard arrived at the work site, both Red and Sammy were waiting for him. They both looked bad, like they had done a good deal more drinking last evening than was typically the case. Red's eyes were more yellow than white, and covered with crimson lines where his capillaries denoted self-indulged abuse: his evening's activity had obviously been carried out with an addict’s compulsion. The Passion had done one of their better business evenings and the proprietor was quite pleased,- however, he did not have to see the men who were now back at work at excavation site 223. The other crew members did not appear to have fared much better; Sammy's hands were shaking and his color was paste and pale.
"We want the goblet and the box, Richard," said Sammy, his voice betraying his nerves.
"What are we going to do, go sell them? I'm ready. I think you were right Sammy, those artifacts just aren't natural, they're something bad."
"Not sell them, Richard. We're going to bury them again, so that no one can get there hands on them."
Richard looked at his own hands which were still trembling, "Fuck it, why not? The chalice and the cube are both in my lunch box. I'll get them." All three men walked over to where Richard had parked his car. All three men stood looking through the back window at the black lunch box for several minutes before Sammy finally opened the door. Richard reached in and pulled out the pail, set it on the roof of the car and opened it. All three men looked with disbelief when they saw the black box was empty, "They're gone," Richard said, "I swear they were both there last night, and the car was still locked this morning."
"We're too late," said Sammy.
"Praise the Destroyer," said Red, and Sammy and Richard took several steps away from him.
"What did you say, Red?" asked Sammy.
"I didn't say nothing. Now where in the hell are those things we dug up?" Red's eyes looked worse than they did earlier. They appeared glazed over with a milky white haze.
(9)
About two hours after Richard left for work, Kate and Philip awoke and got out of bed.
"Well, let’s get you dressed for the day, big guy, and then go get some breakfast," Kate said to her boy as she carried him towards his room.
Philip saw them first, he didn't say anything, Kate just saw the fear she had seen last night return to his face. She looked over at his small bed with the cartoon character sheets and saw what the boy was looking at. There in the center of the bed sat the chalice and the gold box. Kate screamed and ran from the room carrying Philip. The boy still had not made a sound. Philip pulled the little monkey—bear close to him and thought he heard it say, "Be strong, big guy. Be strong."
Chapter Seven
Decisions in the Dark
Richard and Sammy were both in the car when Sammy asked, "You coming with us, Red?"
The man smiled, turned and walked away from the Omni. Red's gait was hesitant and rigid, as if he had just been hit hard on the head.
"I guess that answers our question, " said Richard as he put the car in gear and drove out of the construction site.
"He's gone. Something's really wrong with him," said Sammy, looking back at Red who was now walking towards his own car. 
Richard didn't look back, he had too much on his own mind. The early morning roads were still covered with a thin layer of ice and he was focused on his driving and his family. As he thought of Kate and Philip, his body seemed to fill with fire. He had always kidded Kate about her "intuition thing" but he knew it was real. Richard's intuition was on full force and every signal he got indicated that things were bad, very bad. He bit down hard on his upper lip and managed to push the Omni up over sixty. When they were less than a mile from his home, Richard said, "Sammy, I'm scared shitless. I don't really know why, but I think something bad has happened or is going to happen to my family. I mean, it really sounds stupid when you think about it. I find an old cup and a gold box and now I'm racing home afraid of what I'm going to find. What do you think those things were anyway? I mean, you seemed to have some idea that they were bad, that something was wrong even before the accidents at the site. Right?"
Sammy didn't respond, he was looking at the three black shapes which were several hundred yards ahead, standing in the middle of the road.
Richard saw them too and hit the brakes, which was about as effective on the icy road as trying to stop a dump truck with your feet. The car just kept moving along at over sixty miles an hour. An old driver's education teacher's voice yelled inside his mind. "When you're in trouble, big trouble the best thing to do is head for the pit, the side of the road. Don't never hit anything head on, if you can help it. There isn't anything worse."
Richard turned the wheel and headed towards the pit.
(2)
Kate began to run as soon as she saw the chalice. She just pulled Philip to her chest and started down the stairs, taking them two at a time. She had reached the front door before she heard the laughter.
(3)
The small car and it's occupants began to roll in the air. The Omni had hit a soft shoulder on its dive into the pit, dropping the passenger side tires out from under the car like a well placed kick from God...and then they were rolling.
The entire interior of the Omni had taken on light, and time had gone slow motion. Both Richard and Sammy could see everything with a clarity unequal to anything they had ever known. Richard was amazed at the detail he became aware of, every little piece of dirt and grime that had stowed away on his boots from the work site became visible. He looked and saw Sammy's face, his eyes and mouth made three large "0's" like a Halloween ghost. Richard was sure his face was the mirror image of his passenger's. Then the little car was no longer flying but had hit the earth and hit hard. The sound was two thunder clouds in serious battle, the light intensified, although that would have seemed impossible. Richard heard himself groan, the sound was familiar but far away. He felt no pain as his world went black.
(4)
What Kate had first thought to be laughter was chanting. She was aware of the same sound over and over again as she pulled on the front door like she was in a tug—a—war for her life. Philip had started to cry. Kate thought she heard, "The days are over," which frightened her immensely. However, if she had made out the Words correctly, as Red Treman had, she would have become frozen in horror.
The chant, "Praise the Destroyer," repeated again as Kate finally won the battle with the door.
(5)
Richard didn't know how long he had been out, when he saw the sunshine. He was aware that Sammy was leaning down over him. He was also aware that something heavy was on his legs. A sticky feeling ran down from the back of his neck past his knees, it was warm where he was laying. Richard thought for a second that he must have messed himself like a baby during the accident, the results of that mess was now providing him with this sensation of warmth and wetness. As his eyes focused, Richard was aware of the color and it was wrong. He realized that he must be lying on the dirt, but dirt was brown, wasn't it? He was lying in a pool of redness. Richard felt a brief flare of panic when he knew, when he understood, that he was resting in a pool of his own blood. He looked up at Sammy, whose face was still the mask of Halloween, and tried to reach up and grab him. His arms wouldn't move; he pulled and pulled hard, but his  limbs still remained pinned. Richard lifted his head and looked at his chest, less than a foot down he could see the weather beaten roof of his car. "I should have waxed this," he thought, as blackness overtook him once again. Richard was awakened by screaming. As he pulled the consciousness close to him like a coat from the cold, he realized the screams were his own. Sammy still hung over him like a dog over his dinner.
"Sammy, am I dying?"
"I don't think so, Richard. I think you're going to be fine," Sammy lifted his eyes away. Richard knew he was lying. 
Richard turned his head and not five hundred yards away, he could see the familiar grey and white tract house, his home. "We almost made it, didn't We?" he said, as Richard rolled his head back over the dirt to look up at Sammy.
"Yeah, almost," Sammy voice sounded far away and muted.
"What were those things in the road, Sammy? Did we hit them? Were they people?"
"I don't know. They're gone now, " Sammy had seen the shadow shapes move across the field toward the small little grey and white tract home. He knew what they were looking for.
"Sammy! You have to promise me something before I die. You have to!"
"Sure, Richard. But, you're not dying. I know. . ."
"Sammy!"
"Yes, Richard, anything."
"Leave me. Go to my house now. See that Kate and Philip are safe. Get them away from the chalice, get them away," and then his breath was gone. Richard could feel little bubbles forming around his mouth.
"I will, just as soon as someone stops to help out, I‘ll leave."
"Now, Sammy, you have to go now!"
Sammy looked over the field where the shadow shapes had gone, he knew they were inside now.
"OK, Richard, I'll go," he said as he pushed himself to his feet.
"Sammy, promise me you‘ll take care of them. We don't have any family. We didn't have anyone but ourselves. We did have aunt Beatrice, but she died several months ago, now there is no one. We are alone now, Sammy. So, promise me, Sammy. Promise me you'll get them away and keep them safe." Richard's eyes kept rolling around in his head. He felt numb and nauseated.
Sammy thought, "Shit man, I can hardly take care of myself. I couldn't even take care of my own family. I had to leave them in graves that I've never seen and you're asking, no, not asking begging, with your last breaths that I take care of your family. Shit, man." However, he replied to Richard, "Yes, I'll do what I can to take care of them, you have my word, Richard. You have my word." Then Sammy began to run across the frozen field to the grey and white house, towards a promise he knew he must keep.
Richard had rolled his head again to the side, where he attempted to focus on his friend. His friend? He didn't have any friends. Richard's last thoughts, before the blackness claimed him forever were, "God, please let him be my friend. Please let him be my friend."
(6)
Kate had just stepped outside the door with Philip when the shapes began to descend the stairs. She could still hear the chanting when her "intuition" was struck with a power blast which almost dropped her to her knees. 
Her husband had just died and she knew it.
(7)
Sammy had little time to consider the possibility that he was injured in the accident. No, not accident, execution was the right word. Sammy knew that Richard had been killed not by icy roads, not by some phantoms in the street, not by two thousand pounds of car resting on his chest. Richard had been killed by the chalice, but why? “Because it wants his son!" screamed the voice which resided in the back of his brain. Sammy believed that he had begun to perspire and wiped the back of his arm across his forehead, his shirt sleeve came away red. He didn't slow his pace, he increased it. God, how he hated that little voice inside his head, particularly when he knew it was right.
Sammy could hear the screaming before he could see the source. He knew that it was Richard's wife. He knew, of course, that she was in trouble. He thought, "Hold on lady, just hold on, I'm coming," he recognized the thought was absurd if not obscene, but it was also very true.
(8)
Kate had allowed herself to slide down an invisible wall and was now seated on the front step. Initially she had started to screaming. Now that was release was gone. In its place was a heavy dull feeling which pressed down on her shoulders. She thought, "What am I supposed to do now to do now?" and the tears began to flow. Philip brought her out of it, "Mommy, Mommy! " The small boy was pointing towards the inside of their house.
She looked through the doorway and saw the shadow shapes on the stairs, she saw that they held the chalice and it's cousin, the gold box. She saw they were coming towards her. Then she thought, "Not towards, but to." She pushed her left hand down hard on the cold concrete and felt as if she bounced to her feet. Kate still held Philip tightly to her chest as she pushed her body to move, to move away from the house and towards the field. Her intuition blared again, "Somethings in the field, there is something in the field that will make us safe," Kate began to run.
(9)
The first of three emergency vehicles, a police cruiser, had arrived at the site of the accident. Burt Williams, a long time veteran of the Lamont police, got out of his car and walked slowly over to the Omni. He saw Richard Wagner's body laying beneath the car. He held his breath, something he had always done when approaching dead bodies. He didn't know why he did it. Maybe it was something about breathing in the death, maybe it was some kind of protection. When Burt got to the body, he reached down and felt for the carotid pulse. He hadn't expected one and there was not a pulse present. Burt walked back to the cruiser to call in a "death on the scene" report. He opened the door and sat back down in the police car, hoping the automobiles heater would warm hini. It did not, the chill was too deep. The chill of death was now in his bones.
"This is Officer Williams, Zero, Alpha, Two, come back," and he released the mike key.
"Go ahead, Alpha-Two,"
"Yeah, we got one Omni, plate number, Two—seven—five—Cystal-Lawrence, resident plates. Single car roll over, driver is dead at the scene. Send an ambulance and additional cruiser. Back, " Approximately a minute later the radio called back to him.
"Plates check out to one Richard Wagner, 267 Pheasant Drive. Emergency assistance enroute."
"Thanks," Burt placed the mic back on the radio and thought, "Shit, the guy was almost home. Hell, I bet I could see his house from here." And the voice inside the back of his brain said, "Ninety percent of traffic fatalities occur within twenty-five miles from home. " Burt informed his inner voice out loud, "No shit Sherlock," and turned the car heater on high.
(10)
"Mrs. Wagner, keep running!" Sammy shouted, still fifty yards distant. He could see the shadow shapes following her, he could see that one held the chalice, one held the box and another held what looked to be a knife.
(11)
The ambulance arrived in about three minutes, "Nice response time," thought Williams.
Three paramedics stepped out of the emergency vehicle, which looked like a modified camper van or motor home.
"Where's the victim?" asked the driver of the medical marvel.
"He's still trapped under the car. I knew I couldn't get him out of there by myself."
"Any other passengers?" asked another of the paramedics.
"It looks like someone came out of the passenger door. But there sure isn't anyone around. I've walked the bank here a couple of times. "
"Probably a woman and she's probably running. They do that more than you would think. They see someone they love die and then it's off to the races." The paramedic turned to his cohorts, "Gary get the binoculars but and start scanning the field. We might have a runner, and if we do, we need to find her or him damn quick, before this mess gets worse."
"What do you mean worse, that guys dead," said the third paramedic, still green, still learning.
"Oh, I know that. The runner, that's what I'm worried about, if there is one. You see, runners from the scene are filled with'energy and don't feel a damned thing. I found one once that had run over a mile with a compound fracture of the ankle. Didn't even know she was hurt, and as cold as it is this morning, some runner could just move far enough away from us to fall out there somewhere and just freeze. That's what I mean by worse. Do you understand now?" 
"Sorry," said the green medic as he watched his more experienced partner go for the binoculars.
(12)
Kate and Sammy merged. Both were breathing hard. Philip was quiet but still held his bear.
"Where's Richard?" asked Kate.
"Mrs. Wagner, I'm afraid there was some..."
"He's dead, isn’t he?"
"Yes."
"No!" Kate dropped to the ground.
Sammy pulled at her arm, trying to lift and her son fmrt. "Mrs. Wagner, we have to get out of here. Those things, whatever they might be, are getting closer. We have to move before they get to us. Do you understand?"
Kate's eyes appeared glazed as she stared up at Sammy. She blinked several times, looked at her son, who was now trembling and holding his little toy like salvation. Kate's eyes then cleared, she reached up and grabbed Sammy's hand and both started running, back towards the highway, back towards the body of Richard Wagner.
(l3)
The second cruiser had just arrived when the men heard Gary yell out, "Therel". Officer Williams and the other two paramedics could see them in the field. It looked like a man, a woman and a child, all heading in their direction. Williams saw the other shapes first, black phantoms floating on air.
"What in the hell are those, ghosts?" he asked his companions.
"I thought they were just shadows, but they aren't moving the same. This sounds nuts, but it looks like they are following those people, so I guess we'll find out pretty damn quick because those people are running to us," rattled off one of the paramedics.
"Not following, chasing," said Burt. 
John Hoffman, the officer from the second cruiser had walked up next to the small group of men. He looked out over the field and saw what was unfolding before them. He didn't say a word, but turned ran back to his car, flashed on lights and sirens and started driving across the field toward the running man and woman. He beat the shapes by a good forty-five seconds, from his window he yelled at Sammy and Kate, "Get in, fastl". The two runners, Sammy, Kate, and Philip still being carried by his mom, still holding Sugar Bear, jumped into the backseat of the cruiser. John drove like he was in some off-road race back to the highway. He pulled the police car up onto the road about a half a mile back of the accident site and then looked in back of him. The field was empty. John got on his radio and called Burt.
"Alpha-Two, you got me?
"Yeah, John, go ahead," responded Burt's voice through the radio.
"Where did those things go? I can't see them anymore. Did they lie down or something?"
"Yeah, something. You may not believe this but they just disappeared when your couple got into the car."
"No shit?"
"No shit. We got the victim out from under the car, took all four of us to move it. Anyway, bring your crew on down so the medics can look them over before I send these medical boys off. Pretty strange
"Too strange, Burt. I'm coming down." When the car arrived at the accident scene, Burt Williams opened the back door of the squad car.
"Were you in this accident, Ma'am?"
"No, my husband was. We live right over there. Can I see him?" asked Kate.
"Ma'am, I'm afraid I have some bad news..." started Burt. Kate cut him off.
"I know he's dead. I just want to see him."
"He's over in the ambulance, Ma'am. But it was a pretty bad accident. Maybe it's not such a good Hidea. . . " again Burt was cut" off, this time by Kate handing Philip to Sammy and stepping out onto the road and then running over to the ambulance.
"Burt, these people look OK. We just got an all available officers call. Something bad's happening down at Giant Food Mart. These people can ride down with the medics. They have to go to the hospital anyway. We need to roll, and now." Burt nodded, shut the back door and trotted back to his car.
"Sir, I have another emergency call. Do you think you, the boy and the victim's wife can ride down to the hospital with the ambulance?" John asked Sammy, who nodded and exited the back of the car holding Philip. John allowed them to get a few feet away and then started his car down the road following Alpha-Two. He picked up his mike, keyed Burt.
"Yeah, what's the scoop?"
"Burt, you know old Red Treman, don't you?"
"Yeah, grew up together. Why?"
"Well, apparently the guy's lost it. He went down to the food mart with a twelve gauge and started blowing people away in the vegetable aisle. I guess he's still in there. It sounds real bad." Burt's little voice told him, "Seventy-five percent of all homicides are committed by someone known to the victim." Again he replied out loud, "No shit, Sherlock," as he flipped on his siren and lights.
Back at the scene, the ambulance was just pulling out. One of the medics had helped Sammy and Philip into the front of the van. Kate was in back with the body of her dead husband, alone. The driver turned on his emergency lights, but no siren and no speed. He was rolling a DOA; he wasn't in any hurry.
Chapter Eight
Atonements
As Sammy looked back into the rear of the ambulance, seeing the face of a woman in shock, he felt the tremendous weight which had [been placed upon his shoulders. He questioned himself, "How did I ever get involved with this bizarre hocus pocus stuff in the first place, how did I get involved with other people period." He had been good at avoiding people and letting them be. A small price to pay to be afforded his own isolation. Sammy hurt inside and he didn't want others to see the sick and ugly feelings which hid within his soul, the guilt, the despair, the pain.. .for allowing them to die. Every day that passed, he felt a deep loneliness and longing for his family. A longing for his two daughters, who would
never grow up, never have families themselves. A longing for his wife who had trusted him completely, and yet he had failed her beyond his most frightening nightmares. He would never see those he loved again and when his family died most of Sammy died with them.
His dreams had been to move his family to the States, to prosperity and into safety. To bring his wife to country where she could be an American and feel safe. This thought hit as he held the little boy in his arms. This small child who no longer had a father.
Sammy thought, "Being safe, maybe that's really all any man wants for his family and everything he does is directed towards that end. That's it, safety and protection, it really isn't money, a home or nice cars. What a man works for is the safety of his family. And maybe to be a friend to someone who needs one, maybe a man works for that too," Sammy watched and listened to Kate as she wailed in grief and trembled and as she held her dead husband's hand which she had pulled out from under the once white, which was now covered with the red blood of her husband.
Philip looked up a Sammy and said, "Daddy no more work. Daddy gone. Momma cry. Me and Sugar Bear take care of her."
Sammy knew the child was trying to understand what was going on around him, but he was too young, too small to understand death. Sammy felt impotent and afraid. He kissed the boy on the top of his head and pulled him close. Philip began to cry. Sammy thought, "Maybe he does understand. God, I sure hope not, but maybe he does." The hospital came into view.

Red Treman had seen the shadow shapes; in fact they had talked to him. He had left the Poison Passion Lounge last night and gone home. When he arrived there the shapes were waiting for him. The faceless shadows, at least Red believed the shapes were faceless, and for that he thanked God. (The last time he had the D.T's, after staying off the booze for a full three days, he was tormented, terrified. Everywhere Red looked there were bugs, snakes and other horrible crawling creatures he could not recognize. Red did not believe he was encountering another case of Delirium tremens. Red was positive that what he was seeing was real, very real. Still he was very thankful there were no bugs—-Red hated bugs—
Then these black phantoms gave him instructions on what needed to be done to atone for the crew's trespass, or discovery; either way it didn't matter. Red couldn't help it, but he believed them and when shadow shapes disappeared from his apparent, their voices carried away with the wind, and although it would have seemed impossible, Red thought he could hear the wind say, "It must be done. It must be done and no one will ever understand the sacrifice you are making for your fellow men. Do it, Red. You must do what you have been destined to do."
So while Red's wife, Becky Ann, was sleeping, (she always slept when he was drunk, for she couldn't stand to see him in that condition: mean, cruel and unreasonable). Red took advantage of his solitude and spent the rest of the night preparing for the event which would occur the next morning: the deaths required by the shadow shapes who rode upon the wind. Red understood quite clearly, and with total assurance that without atonement the world would come to an end. Red thought, "Someone has to be a hero whether they are understood or not." He hoped he wasn't crazy, maybe he was, but it didn't matter anymore, for Red had crossed over and Red had his orders.
Red was very good at following orders.

The body was removed from the ambulance and pronounced a DOA. Two hospital attendants took Richard's remains to the hospital morgue.
"Mrs. Wagner, would like his watch and wedding ring? Some people do, it gives them something to hold onto and remember," asked one of the nurses. Think about it for a couple minutes and I'll be right back."
Kate was repeating to herself over again, like some kind of mystic mantra, "This isn't real. It must be some horrible of mistake. Richard was a careful driver. He was always so careful. I know that in

just a few minutes I'll just wake up. It has to be one of those horrible dreams that seem so real, one of those dreams that you just can't wake up from. It isn't real. I know it isn't real. I've always been a good ’person, Richard has always been a good person. God couldn't allow it, he just couldn't allow something so horrible to happen to people like us. Come on Kate! Wake up now, let it be all over."
Still she did believe, for she had held the dead and cold hand of her husband, and his blood still covered her hands, an tangible piece of evidence which belonged to Kate alone.
The E.R., nurse returned, just as she had said, within less than five minutes. "Mrs. Wagner, did you have enough time to think what I had asked? Of course, if you would prefer a little more time, or if you would like me to collect your husbands belongs, until you make a decision, I would certainly do so. I believe I know how difficult this is, I myself have be fortunate enough to never experience such a tragedy. But I have seen my share. Like I said, Mrs. Wagner, anything, I can do, anything at all."
"I thought about it, and yes I would like his things," Kate's voice was so quiet and distorted by her grief that the E.R. nurse could not hear her, so Kate simply nodded, making clear that she did desire Richard's belongings. 
"I'll have someone bring them to you. Is there anything else I can do?" asked the nurse. Kate thought, "Yes, can you make this all a bad dream? Make this something that never really happened?" But, instead said, "No, nothing, but thank you for your offer."
The nurse left Kate, Sammy and Philip standing in the hospital emergency waiting room, apparently to go find someone to bring back Richard's watch and ring, or to get away from their pain.
"Take care of them, Sammy. Take care of them for me," the voice in the back of Sammy's head told him. He thought, "I had better get a plan together, the hospital staff are going to tell us to go home real soon, tell us to get some rest. Impossible yes, but they will insist and I don't know what to do then. Think, Sammy, think." Philip was looking at him, his face filled with questions, all unanswerable. However, one question did stand out in the boy's longing and needing eyes. "Are my mommy and I going to still be OK. Tell me everything will work out. Please mister, I am so afraid and do understand."
"Things will work out, little guy. I'll see to it that they do. Believe me, OK?" Philip again rested his head on Sammy's chest, seeking comfort where it was available.

"Mrs. Wagner, I think it would be a good idea for you and your son to go on home. There is nothing else that can be done here tonight. And sometimes the stress of being in a hospital can only make things more difficult than they already are. But, if you do have any questions, if any of the staff can be of assistance in any manner, please give us a call. Ask for Peggy, in ICU. That's me and I'll do whatever I can. Mrs. Wagner, do you think it would be possible to call a relative or someone close who could come pick you up?"
"My husband and I were only children. Both sets of our parents have died, sometime ago. So I don't think that would be possible."
"Kate, how about that friend of yours, Sammy. Do you think he could drive you home?"
"We all rode here in the ambulance, so I don't think that would work."
"Do you have money for a cab?"
"No, I left my house without a purse. I didn't think I would need it. I guess I was wrong, huh?"
Sammy heard this and said, "I have a little cash; I 'll get the cab." Both Kate and the nurse looked grateful.

Red Treman was smiling as he walked into the small food mart. He was on a mission. He wasted no time in beginning what he had been told must be done. He carried the twelve gauge shotgun loaded with double 00 magnum shells. Everyone in town knew Red for years, no one was overly concerned that he had carried a shotgun into the food store, after all this was the Midwest, rural Midwest and guns were as common as flies on a hot summer afternoon. Everyone just assumed he did not want to leave his prize possession but in his truck someone wish to the gun by breaking out his back window. So naturally, Red carried the shotgun into the store, not so unusual for Lamont.
Red preceded down the vegetable aisle and positioned himself in back of a large bin filled with potatoes. The store was crowded and seconds later, Red said, "For the atonement of what we have done. God please forgive me." Then Red began to fire.
The first shot blasted into the back of an elderly woman who was examining grapefruit. She dropped the large citrus and fell to the floor. The second, hit a young man looking over the fresh beans. He screamed as a hole the size of a volleyball blasted through his back. After this second shot, the patrons of the small store began to scream and dive for some kind of cover. Not that there was much in the way of cover, so the majority of shoppers just ran around in a panic yelling, "There's a crazy man shooting everyone back here! Please, do something! Oh, God, please do Something! We're going to die!" The man with the volleyball hole in his mid-section was still walking. It seemed impossible, for Red could see right through the man. Finally, a bloody spray escaped his body; he went into convulsions and then he died. "Impossible," thought Red as he brought up the shotgun and took aim on a teenager running past the carrots.
Seven people were now dead and several other were wounded. All this had occurred within the first three minutes of this insane rampage. By the time Burt Williams and John Hoffman arrived at the food mart, everyone who had been in Red‘s aisle were dead or gone. The two policemen both got out of their cars; called for additional backup and started walking towards the supermarket.
"I don't ever remember a day like this one, John. Maybe this is some omen from the Lord that I should retire and raise horses. What do you think?"
"If we live through this one, Buddy, any chance that I might be able to go with you? I like horses too, and I'm pretty good with them."
"Sounds like a plan to me, John. Let's get through this one and change our professions."
"You got a deal, Burt. Hell, I'll even volunteer to clean the stables. I'm sure there ain't as much shit in a barn as there is in this town, and the everyday the shit seems to have gotten worse, much worse, and deeper; people have changed, they've gotten sicker or something. You know what I mean, Burt?"
"I know. Let's get this over with." And the two men walked into the front door of the food mart with their guns drawn.
"Hey Red, we know you're back there. This is Burt Williams, your long time buddy from West Valley High. Hell, you remember me, don't you?"
From somewhere in the back of the store the police heard Red say, "Yeah, I know you Burt, and I like you to boot. Why don't you get the hell out of here before something bad happens to you.”
"Hell, Red, let's do it the other way; why don't you drop that bird gun and I'll let you walk right out the front door. You gotta understand, buddy, I just don't want no one else hurt or killed. You and I can deal with the problem once those other people arensafe. Sound like a fair deal? I can't do much more than that. I owe you that Red, we been buddies a long time."
"Burt, I can't leave. I've got to finish what I've started. But, like I was telling you, why don't you get out of here. I'm asking you as my friend."
"Sorry, can't do, Red. This is our job. Why don't you drop that shotgun and come on up here were we can at least talk to you awhile?"
"No way, Burt. I got a job to finish right here, a job I must finish."
"Red, would it help if I got your wife, Becky to come on down and talk to you?"
"No reason to do that, Burt. I don't want to kill her too, but I will. Like I said, this is something I've got to do. I know you couldn't understand; but I'm on a mission. I'm doing this for the guys, for the town, otherwise things will get even worse. I guess you could call this a sacrifice, Burt. Something to please them so that they won't hurt and kill others. Do you understand?"
"Well, Red, maybe I'm starting to. But Red, these people have never done a damn thing to you. If you're trying to commit suicide or something, why don't you put down the gun and come up here, and hell if that's what you’re after, I'll shoot you myself. One clean shot, Red, you won't feel a damn thing. And if that's not it, let me come on back and talk to you awhile, that can't hurt. You can still do what you got to."
"No, Burt. Stay away from me. There's no reason to get yourself killed."
"Well, how about explaining a little of this to me, tell me a little more from back where you are. I think I can hear you pretty well," said Burt. During this conversation John had been quietly walking down the aisle parallel to the vegetable section.
"Burt, it has to be done. It has to be done for atonement, the shadow shapes told me that. If I don't offer them what they want no one in this damn little town of ours will ever be safe."
The concussion of a shot being fired filled the supermarket.
The sound was not that of a shotgun, but rather that of a magnum revolver, John's gun.
"Burt, he's down. Come on back." Burt's legs felt like they were made of clay, heavy and extremely difficult to move, he knew what he would find. He was aware that he was holding his breath.
When he reached the vegetable aisle he could see John leaning over the body of Red Treman. His shotgun was resting several feet away from his body. The weapon rested against one of the bins where it had stopped after John had kick it clear.
Burt looked over at John and asked if he was dead.
"Not yet Burt, but he will be soon. I hit him square in the chest, no other target."
Red looked at Burt and asked him to bend down so he could tell him something. "Watch out partner, no telling what that crazy son of a bitch might try." Burt nodded, but placed his head close to Red's which was covered with blood, he had been coughing up the stuff which was coagulating and clotting in his lungs. Red said something, it was so quiet that Burt leaned his head closer. Red coughed again, which shot blood out of his mouth and on the side of Burt's face. Burt pulled away, wiped his cheek with the back of his arm, and again leaned over and asked Red to whisper what he had to say in his ear.
"Praise the Destroyer, Burt. That's what this is all about. It must be done. Can't you see that?" and then the construction worker died.
"What did he say, Burt?" asked John.
"Oh, nothing really, he just asked if I would look out for his family."
"Little late for that, isn't it, Burt?"
"Yeah, a little late. Let's call in the medics and see how much damage really occurred. And after we get off this call let's go down and look at some horse property."
"Damn straight, Burt. The sooner the better."
Burt had never lied to another officer since he joined the force and he did not understand why he withheld Red's final words to John. He thought that maybe it frightened him too much, he had never known Red to be crazy, something had happened to him. Burt had the feeling that whatever had caused Red to break, was related to the shadow shapes he and the others had seen chasing the young mother, son, and their friend after the car accident.
Burt thought to himself, "Horses, I've always liked horses. I can't take anymore of this shit or someday I might just end up like old Red, shooting innocent shoppers, or kids at a ice cream stand. But shit, more likely, I would just swallow the barrel of my service revolver when I was good and drunk one night and blow the back of my head off. Nope, I think it’s time to go raise horses."
Chapter Nine
Funerals and Flight
Sammy helped Kate and Phillip get into the cab.
“Sammy, Where can we go?” The tears that she had held back at the hospital now escaped ran freely.
Sammy got into the cab and closed the door. The driver asked, “where to?” and Sammy handed him a piece of paper with the address of a nearby motel. He then sat back into the seat and said, “Kate we need a few days so you can arrange Richard’s funeral. After that, I’m not sure yet.
Kate spoke again, “Sammy, did you ever hear that tears are the way one cleanses the misery from our body?”
“Yes, Kate, I’ve hear that.”
“Well, if tears are cleansing, how come they feel so bad?”
“I guess that’s because they’re made of pain, my friend.”
Kate held Sammy’s hand, “You know, you don’t have to take care of us. I’m sure we’ll get along okay.”
“This is my choice Kate,” And the little voice inside Sammy’s head reminded him, “No, it wasn’t your choice, but it became your duty when you gave Richard your word.”
Philip looked at Sammy. “Sanny, you take care of Mommy and me?”
Sammy didn’t know how to answer, so he simply hugged the child, which appeared to answer the boy’s question.
The three of them arrived at the small motel, not far from the hospital. Sammy rented two rooms, one
