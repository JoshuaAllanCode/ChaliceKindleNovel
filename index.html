	<h1>Chalice</h1>
	<h1>By Mark Cameron Jones</h1>
		<h2<Prologue to the Prologue</h2>
  		<h2>The Destroyer's will</h2>
    			<p>All that was evil followed a man by the name of Sabot. He walked upon earth in the same days as did his antithesis, Jesus Christ.</p>
    			<p>While Christ spoke of peace and healing: Sabot spoke of war and disease. While Christ prepared and gave sermons on mountain tops; Sabot spoke in whispers deep within the darkest of caverns. While Christ drew the little children to him; Sabot despised their innocence and their smiles. Both were men of purpose, both were men of power and both were kings. Christ was hated by the people he loved and was crucified. Sabot was loved by the people he hated and died an old man. They died on the same day.</p>
    			<p>On the eve of their deaths, feasts were prepared by their followers. Christ held and raised the golden chalice, (which would become known as the Holy Grail), and said, "This is my blood, drink it all of you," and as the men drank the wine, the covenant between God and man was sealed for eternity.</p>
    			<p>In the darkness of a catacomb, Sabot raised the golden chalice, (which would become known as The Destroyer's will) , and said, "This is the blood of man, drink of it," and as the men drank the sacrificial offering, the covenant between evil and man was sealed for eternity.</p>
    			<p>After their deaths, the Holy Grail was lost to history; never to be recovered. The Destroyer's will gained purpose and was protected, for evil was not afraid. The remaining chalice was to be used as a signal, a call, to bring out those who followed for a convergence of their powers and the destruction of man. The chalice was pure evil. Its purpose and scope had never been contaminated by hesitation or doubt.</p>
    			<p>The chalice was passed down from father to bastard son, throughout the centuries, for use in only such rituals: the black feasts of death which called forth the Destroyer.</p>
 		 <h2>(2)</h2>
			<p>The smell of burning bodies was carried by the night's breeze. It was a heavy and sweet scent which filled one's lungs with despair. Sabot had been dead for over one hundred years. And now, for the first time since the chalice had first held blood, it was to be used once again.</p>
			<p>The victims of the fire, those who had been the necessary sacrifice, were being thrown into hand carts and transported for a more complete burning at the edge of the village.</p>
			<p>The albino, known only as Partee, son of no one—for no man had ever publicly claimed him as his blood-stood and surveyed the destruction. He had done well and as his father would have wished. He held out his left hand, and in his right was a knife. Partee dragged the blade across the flesh of his palm and the blood ran freely. He dropped the knife and picked up the chalice and allowed his blood to drain into the golden goblet. He watched this with fascination and little pain. Soon he was completely transfixed upon the drops of blood which were now filling the chalice. In this state he did not notice that others had begun to join him on top of the hill. There were no introductions, and no words were spoken. Soon there were three, then six and finally thirteen. They all sat in a circle surrounding Partee. The albino finished filling the goblet and slowly raised his eyes to those who had gathered around him.</p>
			<p>"This is the blood of man, drink of it," and he passed the chalice. When the cup returned to his hands, he lifted the goblet and drank, being the last of the circle, Partee finished the remaining sacrament and said, "Go forth, and bring praise upon the Destroyer."</p>
			<p>The men left as silently as they had arrived. In the months that followed the world became more cruel, decadent and diseased. And death reigned freely.</p>
		<h2>(3)</h2>
			<p>The chalice was used seven times over the next thirteen hundred years. The initiation and results of several of those events would never be recorded in history, for some atrocities were simply too perverse to be believed and were therefore clouded in secrecy. Others would be misinterpreted as to their origin,such as, the blood  baths of the crusades and the black plagues of Europe and England. Still, the chalice was always there during such times of death and tragedy and the same message was always given out to the disciples of pain, "Go forth and bring praise upon the Destroyer."</p>
		<h2<(4)</h2>
			<p>"Jonathan, you know that I can never give you my name. But I will provide you with the greatest of gifts. Something which will bring you power the likes of such you cannot believe. This same gift was given to me in my eighteenth year, by my father, who also could not provide me with the legitimacy which I desired. This is how it has always been and how it shall always be until the earth is no longer, this gift must be passed on to a bastard son."</p>
			<p>The young man who stood with the older were both of that rare recessive disorder: both were albinos.</p>
			<p>"What can you give me, Father, that shall remove the shame I have endured for so many years? The shame of being half a man, the shame of having to listen to the whispers as I walk alone on the streets?"</p>
			<p>"My son, I myself have never used the gift which I 'm offering you. There was not the need and perhaps I was not strong enough. " The older man reached into a soiled leather bag and pulled out a gold chalice. He handed it to the younger man.</p>
			<p>"What is this, Father? Some joke? Am I supposed to be pleased with a gold cup? Is this supposed to atone for my pain?"</p>
			<p>"That gold cup is known as the Destroyer's Will. It possesses immense power, and it shares such power with anyone who is chosen to protect it from harm.</p>
			<p>How do you think I acquired the' wealth that you envy? I was not born to riches. I, like you, was a bastard and had nothing, nothing until my father presented me with the chalice and then everything changed. Women desired me. Men feared me and wealth seemed to come from everything that I touched. The same will happen to you, my son, if you abide by the will of the chalice. The chalice is said to be pure evil, but that should not frighten you for evil is a force, a power to use as you so please. There is however one requirement, and that is if the chalice desires to be fed—-and you will know if such a time comes-—you must do so. The ritual that you must use, and the answers to any questions that you may have are contained within this book. " Once again the old man reached into the leather bag and pulled out a large black book.</p>
			<p>"This is the book of the Destroyer. Read it, all of it, and you will understand. There is one other thing that you must know. To be the protector of the chalice is your destiny and you do not have a choice in that matter. If you do not care for the chalice, or if you fail to act as its protector you will die a most unpleasant death. But again, do not be frightened, you were damned the day you were born. It was your fate as it is mine." The old man handed the book to his son.</p>
			<p>The younger albino held the chalice and the book in his hands. He thought it somewhat funny that his father kept telling him not to be frightened, for he was not frightened by anything. As far as evil was concerned, he was already very well versed in that area, taking whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. He knew that he was damned and the thought did not upset him. Jonathan realized that he had been given a great gift, a gift of power and influence, a gift that would assist him in achieving whatever he may desire: the gift of evil.</p>
			<p>"I shall not see you again, boy," said the older man as he turned and walked off into the darkness. Jonathan was now a powerful man. He turned and walked off toward his new life. The chalice felt strong and at home within his hands. "Praise the Destroyer," he said, although at the time he did not understand why.</p>
		<h2>Prologue</h2>
		<h2>Devil's Parade</h2>
			<p>Barnett had returned from Viet Nam just six months ago. He was one of the last to leave the country back in 1972. Now he was working for the L.A.P.D. He wasn't really sure how much he liked police work, but he never got bored. Bill had heard the stories about policemen who spent the majority of their time hanging around in donut  shops, drinking coffee, laughing with the regulars, and gaining weight. L.A., wasn't that way, when you were on duty you were under fire. In this big city anyone could target out a cop and blow him away. And the reason behind it could be anything from some fight with a spouse, to radio messages from Mars; in other words someone really didn't need a reason to shoot a cop. The police were convenient targets easily identified, and scattered around the city. Their uniforms acted like magnets for the hate and mind diseases which grew like weeds in a forgotten garden: this city of L.A.</p>
			<p>Bill had a couple of things going for him: he was a big man, over six four and close to two hundred and fifty pounds, (and that was muscle, well, mostly muscle), and secondly, Bill Barnett could read minds. Both of these characteristics tended to be very helpful in maintaining his own prime objective of staying alive within the City of Angels.</p>
			<p>Of course Bill didn't tell a lot of people he could read their thoughts. First off, Bill didn't like looking around in someone's private things, like their underwear drawers, personal diaries, or their minds. Secondly, being able to pick up on someone's thoughts just wasn't the kind of thing that you told someone, unless you wanted to end up on the backward of some state nut-hut making baskets and smiling for the psychiatrists. Instead, people just tended to think that Bill was perceptive or intuitive, perhaps very intuitive, but being intuitive makes someone interesting and valuable, whereas reading minds makes them a freak. Bill thought it was just fine that his friends and enemies alike thought he was damn perceptive. Bill just agreed with them, even if he could 'see' they were thinking, "Son of a bitch is always taking all the glory. One day I 'm going kick his ass."</p>
			<p>Bill wasn't married, probably never would be, his gift got in the way. Bill didn't have any family left anywhere, well he did, but his parents had been so frightened by his abilities they had closed themselves out of his life many years ago. Bill was a loner, he wasn't sure if he liked that fact, but at least he understood the requirements of the role. And pretty soon, everywhere he went or had been, he became, "Big 01' quiet Bill. " He wasn't that old, twenty—seven, but he was quiet, not that Bill was a shy man, but a man of few words; stoic. Still the name stuck and Bill figured he could have been dubbed a lot worse, so he began to wear his nick name like a jacket and everyone was used to seeing him in those colors: big and quiet.</p>
			<p>Bill's partner was a man named Steve Rivera. Steve's parents had come over from Cuba in the early fifties. Steve wasn't all that thrilled with his heritage, and he often thought of changing his last name to Rivers, but he figured it would hurt his parents, make his mother cry, his father angry and so on, so he didn't. Steve didn't like the job of breaking in new recruits. He thought it was dangerous, and Steve didn't get off on danger. Steve had been on the force for eleven years and after that amount of time you learned that danger and death went together. But Bill was different. Hell, Steve felt safe around Bill. Sometimes he felt like he was the rookie. Bill had a real presence about him and the people on the street could feel it. The two of them had been doing a great job cleaning up their beat. Bill just seemed to know who was causing the trouble, who had done what and where. Steve had concluded that the guy was some kind of psychic. Still he never let Bill in on his conclusion. Steve understood people liked to be respected for their intuition and their perceptive abilities and not dubbed as some kind of circus freak. So he never told Bill he thought he was psychic. Steve was a very perceptive guy.</p>
			<p>Of course Bill knew that Steve was aware of his gift. He didn't ride around with his partner all day long, five days a week, for years and not know what Steve was thinking. Still, Bill never said anything to Steve which would have indicated that he could read his partner's mind. Besides being able to read minds, Bill also tended to be very a perceptive man. The two men had been partners for eight years on the morning that Bill shot Joe Mullins.</p>
		<h2>(2)</h2>
			<p>Until the Devil's Parade, there had been no purpose in his life. He had been involved in crime since he could remember. He committed his first armed robbery when he was fifteen, killed a man before his eighteenth birthday, and had broken into more homes than he could count. Still he had no direction. Joe Mullins just did things, he never thought about what he was going to do. He was just like a bad storm cloud on a hell of a windy day: he could end up anywhere and more often than not, where he ended up bad things would happen. It was just some kind of fate or destiny as far as Joe was concerned, he wrote  the whole mess off by saying, "I'm just a bad seed." Joe would smile after he told people this. It typically made others very uncomfortable and Joe enjoyed making people uncomfortable perhaps as much as he did spending the night with a fifty—dollar whore: both got him off. Besides, it was just his style.</p>
			<p>Joe hadn't had any intention of getting involved in some cult group. Typically, he would have thought the idea revolting.</p>
			<p>Joe Mullins was a lone wolf, others just tended to get into his way. But then he was held in jail for a couple of days, with a cell-mate named McKey. McKey was a member of the Devil's Parade and knew all kinds of neat hocus—pocus shit, like making the guards say things they hadn't intended on saying and making Joe scratch his balls even if he hadn't wanted to. McKey said it was his 'will' that made people do what he wanted and that he could make someone do just about anything.</p>
			<p>"What about killing someone? Could you make someone do that?" Joe had asked McKey.</p>
			<p>"Probably not. It's gotta be in them, they would have had to have done it before. But let me tell you this, and it's the whole point of the Parade: if you can convince someone that nothing is true, that there is no right or wrong, then you can use your 'will' to get them to do whatever you desire. Pretty slick, huh, Sparky?"</p>
			<p>"What's this Sparky shit?"</p>
			<p>"I just like saying it, Sparky."</p>
			<p>"Well, I'd just like to smash in your fucking face. No one calls me, 'Sparky'," said Joe as he tried to lunge at McKey. He couldn't move. "Hey, what is this shit?"</p>
			<p>"You're just responding to my will, Sparky."</p>
			<p>Joe decided he wanted to get involved in the Parade after that day. The Parade could offer him something even more important than making people uncomfortable. The Parade could offer him control and power.</p>
			<p>Joe ran into McKey later that month, in a low class tequila bar on the west side, (Joe had been released from jail the authorities didn't have enough evidence to hold him).</p>
			<p>"Hey, McKey, I'd like to join that group of yours. Any problem?"</p>
			<p>"No problem, if you can get past initiation."</p>
			<p>"What initiation?"</p>
			<p>"You have to do something horrible," McKey smiled.</p>
			<p>"Well, I've done horrible things my whole life," said Joe, smiling back.</p>
			<p>"Yeah, but you have to do something horrible for absolutely no reason at all. No reason other than to bring glory upon the One we serve. In the past you've always had a reason. Maybe very small reasons, but still reasons, like someone got in your way or you wanted something that they had, but you had a reason. To get into the Parade you have to change to balance of innocence. You kill someone for no reason what so ever. You do that, Sparky and you'll get into the Parade."</p>
			<p>"No reason at all?"</p>
			<p>"No reason, Sparky. You just do."</p>
			<p>"I can do that."</p>
			<p>"I thought that you probably could," McKey smiled again.</p>
After the conversation Joe left the bar and walked home to his little apartment on the west side. He thought long into the night about what he could do that would be so deplorable as to guarantee his acceptance into the Parade. Joe decided that he would kill a group of elementary aged school children. He would just blow them off the fucking earth. It would be easy, just take a few sticks of dynamite into Park Street Elementary, which was less than a block from his home, then place the sticks next to some first or second grade classroom. Maybe a kindergarten room? Yeah, kindergarten. Joe had his plan, now he just needed the materials. He was sure he could do it, and then he would learn how to be powerful. Joe had picked up the dynamite from a ranch supply house later that day. In the evening he was so excited, so filled with anticipation that he couldn't sleep. Joe went back down to the seedy bar where he had run into McKey earlier. And he ran into McKey once more. Joe couldn't contain himself. He told McKey of his plan.
McKey had smiled and said, "Come with me, Joe. You will wear our mark on the day of your glory. " The two of them left the bar and entered a small tattoo parlor. Once inside the parlor, the artist, who was large man with his skin covered with tattoos of women in various suggestive and lewd positions, started to work on Joe. The proprietor placed a tattoo of a playing card, a king, the king of hearts, upon Joe's upper right arm.
The suicide king.
Joe Mullins was now as good as a member of the Devil's Parade. There was just one more requirement, one little thing to do, and Joe was positive he could do it, for killing was in his blood and his destiny was assured; in the morning the children would die.

Bill and Steve came on shift at 6 a.m. and had been on duty less than a hour as Mullins finished his night of drinking and was walking back to his apartment to pick up the explosive. Bill's 'gift' had been on full blast since he had awakened, sometimes it was like that. Bill was picking up everything and everything was very clear. He would see some guy walking his dog, make eye contact, and then Bill would pick up an entire conversation the man had at breakfast. Bill could 'see' if someone had been in a fight with their spouse. He could 'see' if someone had been involved in something he shouldn't have been involved in. The people walking the street, driving cars or passed out on the sidewalks had no secrets this morning, for Bill Barnett could see it all.
Bill saw Joe walking down the sidewalk and Joe's thoughts hit Bill like a Claymore mine.
Bill saw that Joe intended on killing a large number of children. He could see the parents crying; the pain of the dying, and he knew it was going to happen.
Bill didn't say anything to Steve, he just pulled the cruiser over to the curb and opened the door.
"Hey, Bill, what are you doing?" Steve had asked. Bill didn't respond. Steve could tell something was wrong, very wrong. Bill looked like a man with mission, not one of L.A.'s finest. Steve tried another approach, "Come on, Bill, let's go get some coffee. No reason to start the day out on a shitty note."
Bill still didn't respond. He never looked away from Mullins. Bill got out of the car, walked over and touched Joe on the shoulder. Bill was flooded with this man's thoughts. Bill felt a brief moment of panic as he thought, "What do I do? What can I do?"
By this time Mullins was screaming about police brutality and how he had never done a "fucking thing to nobody."
Bill's thoughts raced. The little voice inside his mind was saying, "You've got to do something, Bill. If you don't it will happen. And if the children die you'll be as much to blame as this guy, because you know..." Bill questioned himself, "But what can I do? I mean, the guy hasn't done anything
