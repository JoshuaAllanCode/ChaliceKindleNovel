  <h2>The Destroyer's will</h2>
    <p>All that was evil followed a man by the name of Sabot. He walked upon earth in the same days as did his antithesis, Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>While Christ spoke of peace and healing: Sabot spoke of war and disease. While Christ prepared and gave sermons on mountain tops; Sabot spoke in whispers deep within the darkest of caverns. While Christ drew the little children to him; Sabot despised their innocence and their smiles. Both were men of purpose, both were men of power and both were kings.
Christ was hated by the people he loved and was crucified. Sabot was loved by the people he hated and died an old man. They died on the same day.</p>
    <p>On the eve of their deaths, feasts were prepared by their followers. Christ held and raised the golden chalice, (which would become known as the Holy Grail), and said, "This is my blood, drink it all of you," and as the men drank the wine, the covenant between God and man was sealed for eternity.</p>
    <p>In the darkness of a catacomb, Sabot raised the golden chalice, (which would become known as The Destroyer's will) , and said, "This is the blood of man, drink of it," and as the men drank the sacrificial offering, the covenant between evil and man was sealed for eternity.</p>
    <p>After their deaths, the Holy Grail was lost to history; never to be recovered. The Destroyer's will gained purpose and was protected, for evil was not afraid. The remaining chalice was to be used as a signal, a call, to bring out those who followed for a convergence of their powers and the destruction of man. The chalice was pure evil. Its purpose and scope had never been contaminated by hesitation or doubt.</p>
    <p>The chalice was passed down from father to bastard son, throughout the centuries, for use in only such rituals: the black feasts of death which called forth the Destroyer.</p>

The smell of burning bodies was carried by the night's breeze. It was a heavy and sweet scent which filled one's lungs with despair. Sabot had been dead for over one hundred years. And now, for the first time since the chalice had first held blood, it was to be used once again.
The victims of the fire, those who had been the necessary sacrifice, were being thrown into hand carts and transported for a more complete burning at the edge of the village.
The albino, known only as Partee, son of no one—~for no man had ever publicly claimed him as his blood-~stood and surveyed the destruction. He had done well and as his father would have wished. He held out his left hand, and in his right was a knife. Partee dragged the blade across the flesh of his palm and the blood ran freely. He dropped the knife and picked up the chalice and allowed his blood to drain into the golden goblet. He watched this with fascination and little pain. Soon he was completely transfixed upon the drops of blood which were now filling the chalice. In this state he did not notice that others had begun to join him on top of the hill. There were no introductions, and no words were spoken. Soon there were three, then six and finally thirteen. They all sat in a circle surrounding Partee. The albino finished filling the goblet and slowly raised his eyes to those who had gathered around him.
"This is the blood of man, drink of it," and he passed the chalice. When the cup returned to his hands, he lifted the goblet and drank, being the last of the circle, Partee finished the remaining sacrament and said, "Go forth, and bring praise upon the Destroyer."
The men left as silently as they had arrived. In the months that followed the world became more cruel, decadent and diseased. And death reigned freely.

The chalice was used seven times over the next thirteen hundred years. The initiation and results of several of those events would never be recorded in history, for some atrocities were simply toa perverse to be believed and were therefore clouded in secrecy. Others would be misinterpreted as to their origin,such as, the blood  baths of the crusades and the black plagues of Europe and England. Still, the chalice was always there during such times .of death and tragedy and the same message was always given out to the disciples of pain, "Go forth and bring praise upon the Destroyer."

"Jonathan, you know that I can never give you my name. But I will provide you with the greatest of gifts. Something which will bring you power the likes of such you cannot believe. This same gift was given to me in my eighteenth year, by my father, who also could not provide me with the legitimacy which I desired. This is how it has always been and how it shall always be until the earth is no longer, this gift must be passed on to a bastard son."
The young man who stood with the older were both of that rare recessive disorder: both were albinos. 
"What can you give me, Father, that shall remove the shame I have endured for so many years? The shame of being half a man, the shame of having to listen to the whispers as I walk alone on the streets?"
"My son, I myself have never used the gift which I 'm offering you. There was not the need and perhaps I was not strong enough. " The older man reached into a soiled leather bag and pulled out a gold chalice. He handed it to the younger man.
"What is this, Father? Some joke? Am I supposed to be pleased with a gold cup? Is this supposed to atone for my pain?"
"That gold cup is known as the Destroyer's Will. It possesses immense power, and it shares such power with anyone who is chosen to protect it from harm.
How do you think I acquired the' wealth that you envy? I was not born to riches. I, like you, was a bastard and had nothing, nothing until my father presented me with the chalice and then everything changed. Women desired me. Men feared me and wealth seemed to come from everything that I touched. The same will happen to you, my son, if you abide by the will of the chalice. The chalice is said to be pure evil, but that should not frighten you for evil is a force, a power to use as you so please. There is however one requirement, and that is if the chalice desires to be fed—-and you will know if such a time comes-—you must do so. The ritual that you must use, and the answers to any questions that you may have are contained within this book. " Once again the old man reached into the leather bag and pulled out a large black book.
"This is the book of the Destroyer. Read it, all of it, and you will understand. There is one other thing that you must know. To be the protector of the chalice is your destiny and you do not have a choice in that matter. If you do not care for the chalice, or if you fail to act as its protector you will die a most unpleasant death. But again, do not be frightened, you were damned the day you were born. It was your fate as it is mine." The old man handed the book to his son.
The younger albino held the chalice and the book in his hands. He thought it somewhat funny that his father kept telling him not to be frightened, for he was not frightened by anything. As far as evil was concerned, he was already very well versed in that area, taking whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. He knew that he was damned and the thought did not upset him. Jonathan realized that he had been given a great gift, a gift of power and influence, a gift that would assist him in achieving whatever he may desire: the gift of evil.
"I shall not see you again, boy," said the older man as he turned and walked off into the darkness. Jonathan was now a powerful man. He turned and walked off toward his new life. The chalice felt strong and at home within his hands. "Praise the Destroyer," he said, although at the time he did not understand why.
Prologue
Devil's Parade
Bill Barnett had returned from Viet Nam just six months ago. He was one of the last to leave the country back in 1972. Now he was working for the L.A.P.D. He wasn't really sure how much he liked police work, but he never got bored. Bill had heard the stories about policemen who spent the majority of their time hanging around in donut  shops, drinking coffee, laughing with the regulars, and gaining weight. L.A., wasn't that way, when you were on duty you were under fire. In this big city anyone could target out a cop and blow him away. And the reason behind it could be anything from some fight with a spouse, to radio messages from Mars; in other words someone really didn't need a reason to shoot a cop. The police were convenient targets easily identified, and scattered around the city. Their uniforms acted like magnets for the hate and mind diseases which grew like weeds in a forgotten garden: this city of L.A.
Bill had a couple of things going for him: he was a big man, over six four and close to two hundred and fifty pounds, (and that was muscle, well, mostly muscle), and secondly, Bill Barnett could read minds. Both of these characteristics tended to be very helpful in maintaining his own prime objective of staying alive within the City of Angels.
Of course Bill didn't tell a lot of people he could read their thoughts. First off, Bill didn't like looking around in someone's private things, like their underwear drawers, personal diaries, or their minds. Secondly, being able to pick up on someone's thoughts just wasn't the kind of thing that you told someone, unless you wanted to end up on the backward of some state nut-hut making baskets and smiling for the psychiatrists. Instead, people just tended to think that Bill was perceptive or intuitive, perhaps very intuitive, but being intuitive makes someone interesting and valuable, whereas reading minds makes them a freak. Bill thought it was just fine that his
